<h2>NOTE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>
<p>This work differs from its companion volume in offering
something more like a continuous personal history than was
necessary in the case of such a man as Voltaire, the story of whose
life may be found in more than one English book of repute. Of
Rousseau there is, I believe, no full biographical account in our
literature, and even France has nothing more complete under this
head than Musset-Pathay's <i>Histoire de la Vie et des Ouvrages de
J.J. Rousseau</i> (1821). This, though a meritorious piece of
labour, is extremely crude and formless in composition and
arrangement, and the interpreting portions are devoid of
interest.</p>
<p>The edition of Rousseau's works to which the references have
been made is that by M. Auguis, in twenty-seven volumes, published
in 1825 by Dalibon. In 1865 M. Streckeisen-Moultou published from
the originals, which had been deposited in the library of
Neuch&#226;tel by Du Peyrou, the letters addressed to Rousseau by
various correspondents. These two interesting volumes, which are
entitled <i>Rousseau, ses Amis et ses Ennemis</i>, are mostly
referred to under the name of their editor.</p>
<p><i>February, 1873.</i></p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>The second edition in 1878 was revised; some portions were
considerably shortened, and a few additional footnotes inserted. No
further changes have been made in the present edition.</p>
<p><i>January, 1886.</i></p>

<h1>ROUSSEAU.</h1>
<p>&#160;</p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I."></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>PRELIMINARY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Christianity</span> is the name for a great variety of changes which
took place during the first centuries of our era, in men's ways of
thinking and feeling about their spiritual relations to unseen
powers, about their moral relations to one another, about the basis
and type of social union. So the Revolution is now the accepted
name for a set of changes which began faintly to take a definite
practical shape first in America, and then in France, towards the
end of the eighteenth century; they had been directly prepared by a
small number of energetic thinkers, whose speculations represented,
as always, the prolongation of some old lines of thought in
obedience to the impulse of new social and intellectual conditions.
While one movement supplied the energy and the principles which
extricated civilisation from the ruins of the Roman empire, the
other supplies the energy and the principles which already once,
between the Seven Years'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.2" id="Page_i.2">[i.2]</a></span>
 War and the assembly of the States
General, saved human progress in face of the political fatuity of
England and the political nullity of France; and they are now, amid
the distraction of the various representatives of an obsolete
ordering, the only forces to be trusted at once for multiplying the
achievements of human intelligence stimulated by human sympathy,
and for diffusing their beneficent results with an ampler hand and
more far-scattering arm. Faith in a divine power, devout obedience
to its supposed will, hope of ecstatic, unspeakable reward, these
were the springs of the old movement. Undivided love of our
fellows, steadfast faith in human nature, steadfast search after
justice, firm aspiration towards improvement, and generous
contentment in the hope that others may reap whatever reward may
be, these are the springs of the new.</p>
<p>There is no given set of practical maxims agreed to by all
members of the revolutionary schools for achieving the work of
release from the pressure of an antiquated social condition, any
more than there is one set of doctrines and one kind of discipline
accepted by all Protestants. Voltaire was a revolutionist in one
sense, Diderot in another, and Rousseau in a third, just as in the
practical order, Lafayette, Danton, Robespierre, represented three
different aspirations and as many methods. Rousseau was the most
directly revolutionary of all the speculative precursors, and he
was the first to apply his mind boldly to those of the social
conditions which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.3" id="Page_i.3">[i.3]</a></span>
 revolution is concerned by one solution or
another to modify. How far his direct influence was disastrous in
consequence of a mischievous method, we shall have to examine. It
was so various that no single answer can comprehend an exhaustive
judgment. His writings produced that glow of enthusiastic feeling
in France, which led to the all-important assistance rendered by
that country to the American colonists in a struggle so momentous
for mankind. It was from his writings that the Americans took the
ideas and the phrases of their great charter, thus uniting the
native principles of their own direct Protestantism with principles
that were strictly derivative from the Protestantism of Geneva.
Again, it was his work more than that of any other one man, that
France arose from the deadly decay which had laid hold of her whole
social and political system, and found that irresistible energy
which warded off dissolution within and partition from without. We
shall see, further, that besides being the first immediately
revolutionary thinker in politics, he was the most stirring of
reactionists in religion. His influence formed not only Robespierre
and Paine, but Chateaubriand, not only Jacobinism, but the
Catholicism of the Restoration. Thus he did more than any one else
at once to give direction to the first episodes of revolution, and
force to the first episode of reaction.</p>
<p>There are some teachers whose distinction is neither correct
thought, nor an eye for the exigencies of practical organisation,
but simply depth and fervour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.4" id="Page_i.4">[i.4]</a></span>
 of the moral sentiment, bringing with
it the indefinable gift of touching many hearts with love of virtue
and the things of the spirit. The Christian organisations which
saved western society from dissolution owe all to St. Paul,
Hildebrand, Luther, Calvin; but the spiritual life of the west
during all these generations has burnt with the pure flame first
lighted by the sublime mystic of the Galilean hills. Aristotle
acquired for men much knowledge and many instruments for gaining
more; but it is Plato, his master, who moves the soul with love of
truth and enthusiasm for excellence. There is peril in all such
leaders of souls, inasmuch as they incline men to substitute warmth
for light, and to be content with aspiration where they need
direction. Yet no movement goes far which does not count one of
them in the number of its chiefs. Rousseau took this place among
those who prepared the first act of that revolutionary drama, whose
fifth act is still dark to us.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Revolution, like a torrid stream flowing
undiscernible amid the waters of a tumbling sea, is a new way of
understanding life. The social changes desired by the various
assailants of the old order are only the expression of a deeper
change in moral idea, and the drift of the new moral idea is to
make life simpler. This in a sense is at the bottom of all great
religious and moral movements, and the Revolution emphatically
belongs to the latter class. Like such movements in the breast of
the individual, those which stir an epoch have their principle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.5" id="Page_i.5">[i.5]</a></span>

the same craving for disentanglement of life. This impulse to shake
off intricacies is the mark of revolutionary generations, and it
was the starting-point of all Rousseau's mental habits, and of the
work in which they expressed themselves. His mind moved outwards
from this centre, and hence the fact that he dealt principally with
government and education, the two great agencies which, in an old
civilisation with a thousand roots and feelers, surround external
life and internal character with complexity. Simplification of
religion by clearing away the overgrowth of errors, simplification
of social relations by equality, of literature and art by constant
return to nature, of manners by industrious homeliness and
thrift,&#8212;this is the revolutionary process and ideal, and this is
the secret of Rousseau's hold over a generation that was lost amid
the broken maze of fallen systems.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>The personality of Rousseau has most equivocal and repulsive
sides. It has deservedly fared ill in the esteem of the saner and
more rational of those who have judged him, and there is none in
the history of famous men and our spiritual fathers that begat us,
who make more constant demands on the patience or pity of those who
study his life. Yet in no other instance is the common eagerness to
condense all predication about a character into a single
unqualified proposition so fatally inadequate. If it is
indispensable that we should be for ever describing, naming,
classifying, at least it is well, in speaking of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.6" id="Page_i.6">[i.6]</a></span>
 nature as
his, to enlarge the vocabulary beyond the pedantic formulas of
unreal ethics, and to be as sure as we know how to make ourselves,
that each of the sympathies and faculties which together compose
our power of spiritual observation, is in a condition of free and
patient energy. Any less open and liberal method, which limits our
sentiments to absolute approval or disapproval, and fixes the
standard either at the balance of common qualities which
constitutes mediocrity, or at the balance of uncommon qualities
which is divinity as in a Shakespeare, must leave in a cloud of
blank incomprehensibleness those singular spirits who come from
time to time to quicken the germs of strange thought and shake the
quietness of the earth.</p>
<p>We may forget much in our story that is grievous or hateful, in
reflecting that if any man now deems a day basely passed in which
he has given no thought to the hard life of garret and hovel, to
the forlorn children and trampled women of wide squalid
wildernesses in cities, it was Rousseau who first in our modern
time sounded a new trumpet note for one more of the great battles
of humanity. He makes the poor very proud, it was truly said. Some
of his contemporaries followed the same vein of thought, as we
shall see, and he was only continuing work which others had
prepared. But he alone had the gift of the golden mouth. It was in
Rousseau that polite Europe first hearkened to strange voices and
faint reverberation from out of the vague and cavernous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.7" id="Page_i.7">[i.7]</a></span>
 shadow in
which the common people move. Science has to feel the way towards
light and solution, to prepare, to organise. But the race owes
something to one who helped to state the problem, writing up in
letters of flame at the brutal feast of kings and the rich that
civilisation is as yet only a mockery, and did furthermore inspire
a generation of men and women with the stern resolve that they
would rather perish than live on in a world where such things can
be.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>YOUTH.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean Jacques Rousseau</span> was born at Geneva, June 28, 1712. He was
of old French stock. His ancestors had removed from Paris to the
famous city of refuge as far back as 1529, a little while before
Farel came thither to establish the principles of the Reformation,
and seven years before the first visit of the more extraordinary
man who made Geneva the mother city of a new interpretation of
Christianity, as Rome was the mother city of the old. Three
generations in a direct line separated Jean Jacques from Didier
Rousseau, the son of a Paris bookseller, and the first
emigrant.<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a> Thus
Protestant tradition in the Rousseau family dates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.9" id="Page_i.9">[i.9]</a></span>
 from the
appearance of Protestantism in Europe, and seems to have exerted
the same kind of influence upon them as it did, in conjunction with
the rest of the surrounding circumstances, upon the other citizens
of the ideal state of the Reformation. It is computed by the
historians that out of three thousand families who composed the
population of Geneva towards the end of the seventeenth century,
there were hardly fifty who before the Reformation had acquired the
position of burgess-ship. The curious set of conditions which thus
planted a colony of foreigners in the midst of a free polity, with
a new doctrine and newer discipline, introduced into Europe a fresh
type of character and manners. People declared they could recognise
in the men of Geneva neither French vivacity, nor Italian subtlety
and clearness, nor Swiss gravity. They had a zeal for religion, a
vigorous energy in government, a passion for freedom, a devotion to
ingenious industries, which marked them with a stamp unlike that of
any other community.<a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2">[2]</a> Towards the close of the seventeenth century
some of the old austerity and rudeness was sensibly modified under
the influence of the great neighbouring monarchy. One striking
illustration of this tendency was the rapid decline of the Savoyard
patois in popular use. The movement had not gone far enough when
Rousseau was born, to take away from the manners and spirit of his
country their special quality and individual note.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.10" id="Page_i.10">[i.10]</a></span>
The mother of Jean Jacques, who seems to have been a simple,
cheerful, and tender woman, was the daughter of a Genevan minister;
her maiden name, Bernard. The birth of her son was fatal to her,
and the most touching and pathetic of all the many shapes of death
was the fit beginning of a life preappointed to nearly unlifting
cloud. &quot;I cost my mother her life,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and my birth was the
first of my woes.&quot;<a name="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3">[3]</a> Destiny thus touches us with magical
finger, long before consciousness awakens to the forces that have
been set to work in our personality, launching us into the universe
with country, forefathers, and physical predispositions, all fixed
without choice of ours. Rousseau was born dying, and though he
survived this first crisis by the affectionate care of one of his
father's sisters, yet his constitution remained infirm and
disordered.</p>
<p>Inborn tendencies, as we perceive on every side, are far from
having unlimited irresistible mastery, if they meet early encounter
from some wise and patient external will. The father of Rousseau
was unfortunately cast in the same mould as his mother, and the
child's own morbid sensibility was stimulated and deepened by the
excessive sensibility of his first companion. Isaac Rousseau, in
many of his traits, was a reversion to an old French type. In all
the Genevese there was an underlying tendency of this kind. &quot;Under
a phlegmatic and cool air,&quot; wrote Rousseau, when warning his
countrymen against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.11" id="Page_i.11">[i.11]</a></span>
 inflammatory effects of the drama, &quot;the
Genevese hide an ardent and sensitive character, that is more
easily moved than controlled.&quot;<a name="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4">[4]</a> And some of the episodes in their history
during the eighteenth century might be taken for scenes from the
turbulent dramas of Paris. But Isaac Rousseau's restlessness, his
eager emotion, his quick and punctilious sense of personal dignity,
his heedlessness of ordered affairs, were not common in Geneva,
fortunately for the stability of her society and the prosperity of
her citizens. This disorder of spirit descended in modified form to
the son; it was inevitable that he should be indirectly affected by
it. Before he was seven years old he had learnt from his father to
indulge a passion for the reading of romances. The child and the
man passed whole nights in a fictitious world, reading to one
another in turn, absorbed by vivid interest in imaginary
situations, until the morning note of the birds recalled them to a
sense of the conditions of more actual life, and made the elder cry
out in confusion that he was the more childish of the two.</p>
<p>The effect of this was to raise passion to a premature
exaltation in the young brain. &quot;I had no idea of real things,&quot; he
said, &quot;though all the sentiments were already familiar to me.
Nothing had come to me by conception, everything by sensation.
These confused emotions, striking me one after another, did not
warp a reason that I did not yet possess, but they gradually shaped
in me a reason of another cast and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.12" id="Page_i.12">[i.12]</a></span>
 temper, and gave me bizarre and
romantic ideas of human life, of which neither reflection nor
experience has ever been able wholly to cure me.&quot;<a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5">[5]</a> Thus these first
lessons, which have such tremendous influence over all that follow,
had the direct and fatal effect in Rousseau's case of deadening
that sense of the actual relations of things to one another in the
objective world, which is the master-key and prime law of
sanity.</p>
<p>In time the library of romances came to an end (1719), and Jean
Jacques and his father fell back on the more solid and moderated
fiction of history and biography. The romances had been the
possession of the mother; the more serious books were inherited
from the old minister, her father. Such books as Nani's History of
Venice, and Le Sueur's History of the Church and the Empire, made
less impression on the young Rousseau than the admirable Plutarch;
and he used to read to his father during the hours of work, and
read over again to himself during all hours, those stories of free
and indomitable souls which are so proper to kindle the glow of
generous fire. Plutarch was dear to him to the end of his life; he
read him in the late days when he had almost ceased to read, and he
always declared Plutarch to be nearly the only author to whom he
had never gone without profit.<a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6">[6]</a> &quot;I think I see my father now,&quot; he wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.13" id="Page_i.13">[i.13]</a></span>
 when
he had begun to make his mark in Paris, &quot;living by the work of his
hands, and nourishing his soul on the sublimest truths. I see
Tacitus, Plutarch, and Grotius, lying before him along with the
tools of his craft. I see at his side a cherished son receiving
instruction from the best of fathers, alas, with but too little
fruit.&quot;<a name="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7">[7]</a> This
did little to implant the needed impressions of the actual world.
Rousseau's first training continued to be in an excessive degree
the exact reverse of our common method; this stirs the imagination
too little, and shuts the young too narrowly within the strait pen
of present and visible reality. The reader of Plutarch at the age
of ten actually conceived himself a Greek or a Roman, and became
the personage whose strokes of constancy and intrepidity
transported him with sympathetic ecstasy, made his eyes sparkle,
and raised his voice to heroic pitch. Listeners were even alarmed
one day as he told the tale of Scaevola at table, to see him
imitatively thrust forth his arm over a hot chafing-dish.<a name="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Rousseau had one brother, on whom the spirit of the father came
down in ample measure, just as the sensibility of the mother
descended upon Jean Jacques. He passed through a boyhood of revolt,
and finally ran away into Germany, where he was lost from sight and
knowledge of his kinsmen for ever. Jean Jacques was thus left
virtually an only child,<a name="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9">[9]</a> and he com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.14" id="Page_i.14">[i.14]</a></span>memorates the homely tenderness
and care with which his early years were surrounded. Except in the
hours which he passed in reading by the side of his father, he was
always with his aunt, in the self-satisfying curiosity of childhood
watching her at work with the needle and busy about affairs of the
house, or else listening to her with contented interest, as she
sang the simple airs of the common people. The impression of this
kind and cheerful figure was stamped on his memory to the end; her
tone of voice, her dress, the quaint fashion of her hair. The
constant recollection of her shows, among many other signs, how he
cherished that conception of the true unity of a man's life, which
places it in a closely-linked chain of active memories, and which
most of us lose in wasteful dispersion of sentiment and poor
fragmentariness of days. When the years came in which he might well
say, I have no pleasure in them, and after a manhood of distress
and suspicion and diseased sorrows had come to dim those blameless
times, he could still often surprise himself unconsciously humming
the tune of one of his aunt's old songs, with many tears in his
eyes.<a name="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>This affectionate schooling came suddenly to an end. Isaac
Rousseau in the course of a quarrel in which he had involved
himself, believed that he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.15" id="Page_i.15">[i.15]</a></span>
 unfairness in the operation of the
law, for the offender had kinsfolk in the Great Council. He
resolved to leave his country rather than give way, in
circumstances which compromised his personal honour and the free
justice of the republic. So his house was broken up, and his son
was sent to school at the neighbouring village of Bossey (1722),
under the care of a minister, &quot;there to learn along with Latin all
the medley of sorry stuff with which, under the name of education,
they accompany Latin.&quot;<a name="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11">[11]</a> Rousseau tells us nothing of the course
of his intellectual instruction here, but he marks his two years'
sojourn under the roof of M. Lambercier by two forward steps in
that fateful acquaintance with good and evil, which is so much more
important than literary knowledge. Upon one of these fruits of the
tree of nascent experience, men usually keep strict silence.
Rousseau is the only person that ever lived who proclaimed to the
whole world as a part of his own biography the ignoble
circumstances of the birth of sensuality in boyhood. Nobody else
ever asked us to listen while he told of the playmate with which
unwarned youth takes its heedless pleasure, which waxes and
strengthens with years, until the man suddenly awakens to find the
playmate grown into a master, grotesque and foul, whose unclean
grip is not to be shaken off, and who poisons the air with the
goatish fume of the satyr. It is on this side that the unspoken
plays so decisive a part, that most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.16" id="Page_i.16">[i.16]</a></span>
 spoken seems but as dust
in the balance; it is here that the flesh spreads gross clouds over
the firmament of the spirit. Thinking of it, we flee from talk
about the high matters of will and conscience, of purity of heart
and the diviner mind, and hurry to the physician. Manhood commonly
saves itself by its own innate healthiness, though the decent apron
bequeathed to us in the old legend of the fall, the thick veil of a
more than legendary reserve, prevents us from really measuring the
actual waste of delicacy and the finer forces. Rousseau, most
unhappily for himself, lacked this innate healthiness; he never
shook off the demon which would be so ridiculous, if it did not
hide such terrible power. With a moral courage, that it needs
hardly less moral courage in the critic firmly to refrain from
calling cynical or shameless, he has told the whole story of this
lifelong depravation. In the present state of knowledge, which in
the region of the human character the false shamefacedness of
science, aided and abetted by the mutilating hand of religious
asceticism, has kept crude and imperfect, there is nothing very
profitable to be said on all this. When the great art of life has
been more systematically conceived in the long processes of time
and endeavour, and when more bold, effective, and far-reaching
advance has been made in defining those pathological manifestations
which deserve to be seriously studied, as distinguished from those
of a minor sort which are barely worth registering, then we should
know better how to speak, or how to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.17" id="Page_i.17">[i.17]</a></span>
 silent, in the present most
unwelcome instance. As it is, we perhaps do best in chronicling the
fact and passing on. The harmless young are allowed to play without
monition or watching among the deep open graves of temperament; and
Rousseau, telling the tale of his inmost experience, unlike the
physician and the moralist who love decorous surfaces of things,
did not spare himself nor others a glimpse of the ignominies to
which the body condemns its high tenant, the soul.<a name="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The second piece of experience which he acquired at Bossey was
the knowledge of injustice and wrongful suffering as things actual
and existent. Circumstances brought him under suspicion of having
broken the teeth of a comb which did not belong to him. He was
innocent, and not even the most terrible punishment could wring
from him an untrue confession of guilt. The root of his constancy
was not in an abhorrence of falsehood, which is exceptional in
youth, and for which he takes no credit, but in a furious and
invincible resentment against the violent pressure that was
unjustly put upon him. &quot;Picture a character, timid and docile in
ordinary life, but ardent, impetuous, indomitable in its passions;
a child always governed by the voice of reason, always treated with
equity, gentleness, and consideration, who had not even the idea of
injustice, and who for the first time experiences an injustice so
terrible, from the very people whom he most cherishes and respects!
What a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.18" id="Page_i.18">[i.18]</a></span>fusion of ideas, what disorder of sentiments, what
revolution in heart, in brain, in every part of his moral and
intellectual being!&quot; He had not learnt, any more than other
children, either to put himself in the place of his elders, or to
consider the strength of the apparent case against him. All that he
felt was the rigour of a frightful chastisement for an offence of
which he was innocent. And the association of ideas was permanent.
&quot;This first sentiment of violence and injustice has remained so
deeply engraved in my soul, that all the ideas relating to it bring
my first emotion back to me; and this sentiment, though only
relative to myself in its origin, has taken such consistency, and
become so disengaged from all personal interest, that my heart is
inflamed at the sight or story of any wrongful action, just as much
as if its effect fell on my own person. When I read of the
cruelties of some ferocious tyrant, or the subtle atrocities of
some villain of a priest, I would fain start on the instant to
poniard such wretches, though I were to perish a hundred times for
the deed.... This movement may be natural to me, and I believe it
is so; but the profound recollection of the first injustice I
suffered was too long and too fast bound up with it, not to have
strengthened it enormously.&quot;<a name="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>To men who belong to the silent and phlegmatic races like our
own, all this may possibly strike on the ear like a false or
strained note. Yet a tranquil appeal to the real history of one's
own strongest im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.19" id="Page_i.19">[i.19]</a></span>pressions may disclose their roots in facts of
childish experience, which remoteness of time has gradually emptied
of the burning colour they once had. This childish discovery of the
existence in his own world of that injustice which he had only seen
through a glass very darkly in the imaginary world of his reading,
was for Rousseau the angry dismissal from the primitive Eden, which
in one shape and at one time or another overtakes all men. &quot;Here,&quot;
he says, &quot;was the term of the serenity of my childish days. From
this moment I ceased to enjoy a pure happiness, and I feel even at
this day that the reminiscence of the delights of my infancy here
comes to an end.... Even the country lost in our eyes that charm of
sweetness and simplicity which goes to the heart; it seemed sombre
and deserted, and was as if covered by a veil, hiding its beauties
from our sight. We no longer tended our little gardens, our plants,
our flowers. We went no more lightly to scratch the earth, shouting
for joy as we discovered the germ of the seed we had sown.&quot;</p>
<p>Whatever may be the degree of literal truth in the Confessions,
the whole course of Rousseau's life forbids us to pass this
passionate description by as overcharged or exaggerated. We are
conscious in it of a constitutional infirmity. We perceive an
absence of healthy power of reaction against moral shock. Such
shocks are experienced in many unavoidable forms by all save the
dullest natures, when they first come into contact with the sharp
tooth of outer cir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.20" id="Page_i.20">[i.20]</a></span>cumstance. Indeed, a man must be either
miraculously happy in his experiences, or exceptionally obtuse in
observing and feeling, or else be the creature of base and cynical
ideals, if life does not to the end continue to bring many a
repetition of that first day of incredulous bewilderment. But the
urgent demands for material activity quickly recall the mass of men
to normal relations with their fellows and the outer world. A
vehement objective temperament, like Voltaire's, is instantly
roused by one of these penetrative stimuli into angry and tenacious
resistance. A proud and collected soul, like Goethe's, loftily
follows its own inner aims, without taking any heed of the
perturbations that arise from want of self-collection in a world
still spelling its rudiments. A sensitive and depressed spirit,
like Rousseau's or Cowper's, finds itself without any of these
reacting kinds of force, and the first stroke of cruelty or
oppression is the going out of a divine light.</p>
<p>Leaving Bossey, Rousseau returned to Geneva, and passed two or
three years with his uncle, losing his time for the most part, but
learning something of drawing and something of Euclid, for the
former of which he showed special inclination.<a name="FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14">[14]</a> It was a question
whether he was to be made a watchmaker, a lawyer, or a minister.
His own preference, as his after-life might have led us to suppose,
was in favour of the last of the three; &quot;for I thought it a fine
thing,&quot; he says, &quot;to preach.&quot; The uncle was a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.21" id="Page_i.21">[i.21]</a></span>
 of pleasure, and
as often happens in such circumstances, his love of pleasure had
the effect of turning his wife into a pietist. Their son was
Rousseau's constant comrade. &quot;Our friendship filled our hearts so
amply, that if we were only together, the simplest amusements were
a delight.&quot; They made kites, cages, bows and arrows, drums, houses;
they spoiled the tools of their grandfather, in trying to make
watches like him. In the same cheerful imitative spirit, which is
the main feature in childhood when it is not disturbed by excess of
literary teaching, after Geneva had been visited by an Italian
showman with a troop of marionettes, they made puppets and composed
comedies for them; and when one day the uncle read aloud an elegant
sermon, they abandoned their comedies, and turned with blithe
energy to exhortation. They had glimpses of the rougher side of
life in the biting mockeries of some schoolboys of the
neighbourhood. These ended in appeal to the god of youthful war,
who pronounced so plainly for the bigger battalions, that the
release of their enemies from school was the signal for the quick
retreat of our pair within doors. All this is an old story in every
biography written or unwritten. It seldom fails to touch us, either
in the way of sympathetic reminiscence, or if life should have gone
somewhat too hardly with a man, then in the way of irony, which is
not less real and poetic than the eironeia of a Greek dramatist,
for being concerned with more unheroic creatures.</p>
<p>And this rough play of the streets always seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.22" id="Page_i.22">[i.22]</a></span>
 to Rousseau a
manlier schooling than the effeminate tendencies which he thought
he noticed in Genevese youth in after years. &quot;In my time,&quot; he says
admiringly, &quot;children were brought up in rustic fashion and had no
complexion to keep.... Timid and modest before the old, they were
bold, haughty, combative among themselves; they had no curled locks
to be careful of; they defied one another at wrestling, running,
boxing. They returned home sweating, out of breath, torn; they were
true blackguards, if you will, but they made men who have zeal in
their heart to serve their country and blood to shed for her. May
we be able to say as much one day of our fine little gentlemen, and
may these men at fifteen not turn out children at thirty.&quot;<a name="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Two incidents of this period remain to us, described in
Rousseau's own words, and as they reveal a certain sweetness in
which his life unhappily did not afterwards greatly abound, it may
help our equitable balance of impressions about him to reproduce
them. Every Sunday he used to spend the day at P&#226;quis at Mr.
Fazy's, who had married one of his aunts, and who carried on the
production of printed calicoes. &quot;One day I was in the drying-room,
watching the rollers of the hot press; their brightness pleased my
eye; I was tempted to lay my fingers on them, and I was moving them
up and down with much satisfaction along the smooth cylinder, when
young Fazy placed himself in the wheel and gave it a half-quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.23" id="Page_i.23">[i.23]</a></span>

turn so adroitly, that I had just the ends of my two longest
fingers caught, but this was enough to crush the tips and tear the
nails. I raised a piercing cry; Fazy instantly turned back the
wheel, and the blood gushed from my fingers. In the extremity of
consternation he hastened to me, embraced me, and besought me to
cease my cries, or he would be undone. In the height of my own
pain, I was touched by his; I instantly fell silent, we ran to the
pond, where he helped me to wash my fingers and to staunch the
blood with moss. He entreated me with tears not to accuse him; I
promised him that I would not, and &#207; kept my word so well that
twenty years after no one knew the origin of the scar. I was kept
in bed for more than three weeks, and for more than two months was
unable to use my hand. But I persisted that a large stone had
fallen and crushed my fingers.&quot;<a name="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The other story is of the same tenour, though there is a new
touch of sensibility in its concluding words. &quot;I was playing at
ball at Plain Palais, with one of my comrades named Plince. We
began to quarrel over the game; we fought, and in the fight he
dealt me on my bare head a stroke so well directed, that with a
stronger arm it would have dashed my brains out. I fell to the
ground, and there never was agitation like that of this poor lad,
as he saw the blood in my hair. He thought he had killed me. He
threw himself upon me, and clasped me eagerly in his arms, while
his tears poured down his cheeks, and he uttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.24" id="Page_i.24">[i.24]</a></span>
 shrill cries. I
returned his embrace with all my force, weeping like him, in a
state of confused emotion which was not without a kind of
sweetness. Then he tried to stop the blood which kept flowing, and
seeing that our two handkerchiefs were not enough, he dragged me
off to his mother's; she had a small garden hard by. The good woman
nearly fell sick at sight of me in this condition; she kept
strength enough to dress my wound, and after bathing it well, she
applied flower-de-luce macerated in brandy, an excellent remedy
much used in our country. Her tears and those of her son, went to
my very heart, so that I looked upon them for a long while as my
mother and my brother.&quot;<a name="FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>If it were enough that our early instincts should be thus
amiable and easy, then doubtless the dismal sloughs in which men
and women lie floundering would occupy a very much more
insignificant space in the field of human experience. The problem,
as we know, lies in the discipline of this primitive goodness. For
character in a state of society is not a tree that grows into
uprightness by the law of its own strength, though an adorable
instance here and there of rectitude and moral loveliness that seem
intuitive may sometimes tempt us into a moment's belief in a
contrary doctrine. In Rousseau's case this serious problem was
never solved; there was no deliberate preparation of his impulses,
prepossessions, notions; no foresight on the part of elders, and no
gradual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.25" id="Page_i.25">[i.25]</a></span>
 acclimatisation of a sensitive and ardent nature in the
fixed principles which are essential to right conduct in the frigid
zone of our relations with other people. It was one of the most
elementary of Rousseau's many perverse and mischievous contentions,
that it is their education by the older which ruins or wastes the
abundant capacity for virtue that subsists naturally in the young.
His mind seems never to have sought much more deeply for proof of
this, than the fact that he himself was innocent and happy so long
as he was allowed to follow without disturbance the easy simple
proclivities of his own temperament. Circumstances were not
indulgent enough to leave the experiment to complete itself within
these very rudimentary conditions.</p>
<p>Rousseau had been surrounded, as he is always careful to
protest, with a religious atmosphere. His father, though a man of
pleasure, was possessed also not only of probity but of religion as
well. His three aunts were all in their degrees gracious and
devout. M. Lambercier at Bossey, &quot;although Churchman and preacher,&quot;
was still a sincere believer and nearly as good in act as in word.
His inculcation of religion was so hearty, so discreet, so
reasonable, that his pupils, far from being wearied by the sermon,
never came away without being touched inwardly and stirred to make
virtuous resolutions. With his Aunt Bernard devotion was rather
more tiresome, because she made a business of it.<a name="FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18">[18]</a> It would be a
distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.26" id="Page_i.26">[i.26]</a></span>
 error to suppose that all this counted for nothing, for
let us remember that we are now engaged with the youth of the one
great religious writer of France in the eighteenth century. When
after many years Rousseau's character hardened, the influences
which had surrounded his boyhood came out in their full force and
the historian of opinion soon notices in his spirit and work a
something which had no counterpart in the spirit and work of men
who had been trained in Jesuit colleges. At the first outset,
however, every trace of religious sentiment was obliterated from
sight, and he was left unprotected against the shocks of the world
and the flesh.</p>
<p>At the age of eleven Jean Jacques was sent into a notary's
office, but that respectable calling struck him in the same
repulsive and insufferable way in which it has struck many other
boys of genius in all countries. Contrary to the usual rule, he did
not rebel, but was ignominiously dismissed by his master<a name="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19">[19]</a> for dulness and
inaptitude; his fellow-clerks pronounced him stupid and incompetent
past hope. He was next apprenticed to an engraver,<a name="FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20">[20]</a> a rough and
violent man, who seems to have instantly plunged the boy into a
demoralised stupefaction. The reality of contact with this coarse
nature benumbed as by touch of torpedo the whole being of a youth
who had hitherto lived on pure sensations and among those ideas
which are nearest to sensations. There were no longer heroic Romans
in Rousseau's universe. &quot;The vilest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.27" id="Page_i.27">[i.27]</a></span>
 tastes, the meanest bits of
rascality, succeeded to my simple amusements, without even leaving
the least idea behind. I must, in spite of the worthiest education,
have had a strong tendency to degenerate.&quot; The truth was that he
had never had any education in its veritable sense, as the process,
on its negative side, of counteracting the inborn. There are two
kinds, or perhaps we should more correctly say two degrees, of the
constitution in which the reflective part is weak. There are the
men who live on sensation, but who do so lustily, with a certain
fulness of blood and active energy of muscle. There are others who
do so passively, not searching for excitement, but acquiescing. The
former by their sheer force and plenitude of vitality may, even in
a world where reflection is a first condition, still go far. The
latter succumb, and as reflection does nothing for them, and as
their sensations in such a world bring them few blandishments, they
are tolerably early surrounded with a self-diffusing atmosphere of
misery. Rousseau had none of this energy which makes oppression
bracing. For a time he sank.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to let the story of the Confessions carry
us into exaggerations. The brutality of his master and the
harshness of his life led him to nothing very criminal, but only to
wrong acts which are despicable by their meanness, rather than in
any sense atrocious. He told lies as readily as the truth. He
pilfered things to eat. He cunningly found a means of opening his
master's private cabinet, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.28" id="Page_i.28">[i.28]</a></span>
 using his master's best
instruments by stealth. He wasted his time in idle and capricious
tasks. When the man, with all the ravity of an adult moralist,
describes these misdeeds of the boy, they assume a certain ugliness
of mien, and excites a strong disgust which, when the misdeeds
themselves are before us in actual life, we experience in a far
more considerate form. The effect of calm, retrospective avowal is
to create a kind of feeling which is essentially unlike our feeling
at what is actually avowed. Still it is clear that his unlucky
career as apprentice brought out in Rousseau slyness, greediness,
slovenliness, untruthfulness, and the whole ragged regiment of the
squalider vices. The evil of his temperament now and always was of
the dull smouldering kind, seldom breaking out into active flame.
There is a certain sordidness in the scene. You may complain that
the details which Rousseau gives of his youthful days are insipid.
Yet such things are the web and stuff of life, and these days of
transition from childhood to full manhood in every case mark a
crisis. These insipidities test the education of home and family,
and they presage definitely what is to come. The roots of
character, good or bad, are shown for this short space, and they
remain unchanged, though most people learn from their fellows the
decent and useful art of covering them over with a little dust, in
the shape of accepted phrases and routine customs and a silence
which is not oblivion.</p>
<p>After a time the character of Jean Jacques was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.29" id="Page_i.29">[i.29]</a></span>
 absolutely broken
down. He says little of the blows with which his offences were
punished by his master, but he says enough to enable us to discern
that they were terrible to him. This cowardice, if we choose to
give the name to an overmastering physical horror, at length
brought his apprentice days to an end. He was now in his sixteenth
year. He was dragged by his comrades into sports for which he had
little inclination, though he admits that once engaged in them he
displayed an impetuosity that carried him beyond the others. Such
pastimes naturally led them beyond the city walls, and on two
occasions Rousseau found the gates closed on his return. His master
when he presented himself in the morning gave him such greeting as
we may imagine, and held out things beyond imagining as penalty for
a second sin in this kind. The occasion came, as, alas, it nearly
always does. &quot;Half a league from the town,&quot; says Rousseau, &quot;I hear
the retreat sounded, and redouble my pace; I hear the drum beat,
and run at the top of my speed: I arrive out of breath, bathed in
sweat; my heart beats violently, I see from a distance the soldiers
at their post, and call out with choking voice. It was too late.
Twenty paces from the outpost sentinel, I saw the first bridge
rising. I shuddered, as I watched those terrible horns, sinister
and fatal augury of the inevitable lot which that moment was
opening for me.&quot;<a name="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>In manhood when we have the resource of our own will to fall
back upon, we underestimate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.30" id="Page_i.30">[i.30]</a></span>
 unsurpassed horror and anguish of
such moments as this in youth, when we know only the will of
others, and that this will is inexorable against us. Rousseau dared
not expose himself to the fulfilment of his master's menace, and he
ran away (1728). But for this, wrote the unhappy man long years
after, &quot;I should have passed, in the bosom of my religion, of my
native land, of my family, and my friends, a mild and peaceful
life, such as my character required, in the uniformity of work
which suited my taste, and of a society after my heart. I should
have been a good Christian, good citizen, good father of a family,
good friend, good craftsman, good man in all. I should have been
happy in my condition, perhaps I might have honoured it; and after
living a life obscure and simple, but even and gentle, I should
have died peacefully in the midst of my own people. Soon forgotten,
I should at any rate have been regretted as long as any memory of
me was left.&quot;<a name="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>As a man knows nothing about the secrets of his own individual
organisation, this illusory mapping out of a supposed Possible need
seldom be suspected of the smallest insincerity. The poor madman
who declares that he is a king kept out of his rights only moves
our pity, and we perhaps owe pity no less to those in all the
various stages of aberration uncertificated by surgeons, down to
the very edge of most respectable sanity, who accuse the injustice
of men of keeping them out of this or that kingdom, of which in
truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.31" id="Page_i.31">[i.31]</a></span>
 their own composition finally disinherited them at the moment
when they were conceived in a mother's womb. The first of the
famous Five Propositions of Jansen, which were a stumbling-block to
popes and to the philosophy of the eighteenth-century foolishness,
put this clear and permanent truth into a mystic and perishable
formula, to the effect that there are some commandments of God
which righteous and good men are absolutely unable to obey, though
ever so disposed to do them, and God does not give them so much
grace that they are able to observe them.</p>
<p>If Rousseau's sensations in the evening were those of terror,
the day and its prospect of boundless adventures soon turned them
into entire delight. The whole world was before him, and all the
old conceptions of romance were instantly revived by the supposed
nearness of their realisation. He roamed for two or three days
among the villages in the neighbourhood of Geneva, finding such
hospitality as he needed in the cottages of friendly peasants.
Before long his wanderings brought him to the end of the territory
of the little republic. Here he found himself in the domain of
Savoy, where dukes and lords had for ages been the traditional foes
of the freedom and the faith of Geneva, Rousseau came to the
village of Confignon, and the name of the priest of Confignon
recalled one of the most embittered incidents of the old feud. This
feud had come to take new forms; instead of midnight expeditions to
scale the city walls, the descendants of the Savoyard marauders of
the sixteenth century were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.32" id="Page_i.32">[i.32]</a></span>
 now intent with equivocal good will on
rescuing the souls of the descendants of their old enemies from
deadly heresy. At this time a systematic struggle was going on
between the priests of Savoy and the ministers of Geneva, the
former using every effort to procure the conversion of any
Protestant on whom they could lay hands.<a name="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23">[23]</a> As it happened,
the priest of Confignon was one of the most active in this good
work.<a name="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24">[24]</a> He
made the young Rousseau welcome, spoke to him of the heresies of
Geneva and of the authority of the holy Church, and gave him some
dinner. He could hardly have had a more easy convert, for the
nature with which he had to deal was now swept and garnished, ready
for the entrance of all devils or gods. The dinner went for much.
&quot;I was too good a guest,&quot; writes Rousseau in one of his few
passages of humour, &quot;to be a good theologian, and his Frangi wine,
which struck me as excellent, was such a triumphant argument on his
side, that I should have blushed to oppose so capital a
host.&quot;<a name="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25">[25]</a> So
it was agreed that he should be put in a way to be further
instructed of these matters. We may accept Rousseau's assurance
that he was not exactly a hypocrite in this rapid complaisance. He
admits that any one who should have seen the artifices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.33" id="Page_i.33">[i.33]</a></span>
 to which he
resorted, might have thought him very false. But, he argues,
&quot;flattery, or rather concession, is not always a vice; it is
oftener a virtue, especially in the young. The kindness with which
a man receives us, attaches us to him; it is not to make a fool of
him that we give way, but to avoid displeasing him, and not to
return him evil for good.&quot; He never really meant to change his
religion; his fault was like the coquetting of decent women, who
sometimes, to gain their ends, without permitting anything or
promising anything, lead men to hope more than they mean to hold
good.<a name="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26">[26]</a>
Thereupon follow some austere reflections on the priest, who ought
to have sent him back to his friends; and there are strictures even
upon the ministers of all dogmatic religions, in which the
essential thing is not to do but to believe; their priests
therefore, provided that they can convert a man to their faith, are
wholly indifferent alike as to his worth and his worldly interests.
All this is most just; the occasion for such a strain of remark,
though so apposite on one side, is hardly well chosen to impress
us. We wonder, as we watch the boy complacently hoodwinking his
entertainer, what has become of the Roman severity of a few months
back. This nervous eagerness to please, however, was the
complementary element of a character of vague ambition, and it was
backed by a stealthy consciousness of intellectual superiority,
which perhaps did something, though poorly enough, to make such
ignominy less deeply degrading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.34" id="Page_i.34">[i.34]</a></span></p>

<p>The die was cast. M. Pontverre despatched his brand plucked from
the burning to a certain Madame de Warens, a lady living at Annecy,
and counted zealous for the cause of the Church. In an interview
whose minutest circumstances remained for ever stamped in his mind
(March 21, 1728), Rousseau exchanged his first words with this
singular personage, whose name and character he has covered with
doubtful renown. He expected to find some gray and wrinkled woman,
saving a little remnant of days in good works. Instead of this,
there turned round upon him a person not more than eight-and-twenty
years old, with gentle caressing air, a fascinating smile, a tender
eye. Madame de Warens read the letters he brought, and entertained
their bearer cheerfully. It was decided after consultation that the
heretic should be sent to a monastery at Turin, where he might be
brought over in form to the true Church. At the monastery not only
would the spiritual question of faith and the soul be dealt with,
but at the same time the material problem of shelter and
subsistence for the body would be solved likewise. Elated with
vanity at the thought of seeing before any of his comrades the
great land of promise beyond the mountains, heedless of those whom
he had left, and heedless of the future before him and the object
which he was about, the young outcast made his journey over the
Alps in all possible lightness of heart. &quot;Seeing country is an
allurement which hardly any Genevese can ever resist. Everything
that met my eye seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.35" id="Page_i.35">[i.35]</a></span>
 the guarantee of my approaching happiness.
In the houses I imagined rustic festivals; in the fields, joyful
sports; along the streams, bathing and fishing; on the trees,
delicious fruits; under their shade, voluptuous interviews; on the
mountains, pails of milk and cream, a charming idleness, peace,
simplicity, the delight of going forward without knowing
whither.&quot;<a name="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27">[27]</a>
He might justly choose out this interval as more perfectly free
from care or anxiety than any other of his life. It was the first
of the too rare occasions when his usually passive sensuousness was
stung by novelty and hope into an active energy.</p>
<p>The seven or eight days of the journey came to an end, and the
youth found himself at Turin without money or clothes, an inmate of
a dreary monastery, among some of the very basest and foulest of
mankind, who pass their time in going from one monastery to another
through Spain and Italy, professing themselves Jews or Moors for
the sake of being supported while the process of their conversion
was going slowly forward. At the Hospice of the Catechumens the
work of his conversion was begun in such earnest as the insincerity
of at least one of the parties to it might allow. It is needless to
enter into the circumstances of Rousseau's conversion to
Catholicism. The mischievous zeal for theological proselytising has
led to thousands of such hollow and degrading performances, but it
may safely be said that none of them was ever hollower than this.
Rousseau avows that he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.36" id="Page_i.36">[i.36]</a></span>
 brought up in the heartiest
abhorrence of the older church, and that he never lost this
abhorrence. He fully explains that he accepted the arguments with
which he was not very energetically plied, simply because he could
not bear the idea of returning to Geneva, and he saw no other way
out of his present destitute condition. &quot;I could not dissemble from
myself that the holy deed I was about to do, was at the bottom the
action of a bandit.&quot; &quot;The sophism which destroyed me,&quot; he says in
one of those eloquent pieces of moralising, which bring ignoble
action into a relief that exaggerates our condemnation, &quot;is that of
most men, who complain of lack of strength when it is already too
late for them to use it. It is only through our own fault that
virtue costs us anything; if we could be always sage, we should
rarely feel the need of being virtuous. But inclinations that might
be easily overcome, drag us on without resistance; we yield to
light temptations of which we despise the hazard. Insensibly we
fall into perilous situations, against which we could easily have
shielded ourselves, but from which we can afterwards only make a
way out by heroic efforts that stupefy us, and so we sink into the
abyss, crying aloud to God, Why hast thou made me so weak? But in
spite of ourselves, God gives answer to our conscience, 'I made
thee too weak to come out from the pit, because I made thee strong
enough to avoid falling into it.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28">[28]</a> So the hopeful convert did fall in, not
as happens to the pious soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.37" id="Page_i.37">[i.37]</a></span>
 &quot;too hot for certainties in this our
life,&quot; to find rest in liberty of private judgment and an open
Bible, but simply as a means of getting food, clothing, and
shelter.<a name="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29">[29]</a>
The boy was clever enough to make some show of resistance, and he
turned to good use for this purpose the knowledge of Church history
and the great Reformation controversy which he had picked up at M.
Lambercier's. He was careful not to carry things too far, and
exactly nine days after his admission into the Hospice, he &quot;abjured
the errors of the sect.&quot;<a name="FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30">[30]</a> Two days after that he was publicly
received into the kindly bosom of the true Church with all
solemnity, to the high edification of the devout of Turin, who
marked their interest in the regenerate soul by contributions to
the extent of twenty francs in small money.</p>
<p>With that sum and formal good wishes the fathers of the Hospice
of the Catechumens thrust him out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.38" id="Page_i.38">[i.38]</a></span>
 their doors into the broad
world. The youth who had begun the day with dreams of palaces,
found himself at night sleeping in a den where he paid a halfpenny
for the privilege of resting in the same room with the rude woman
who kept the house, her husband, her five or six children, and
various other lodgers. This rough awakening produced no
consciousness of hardship in a nature which, beneath all fantastic
dreams, always remained true to its first sympathy with the homely
lives of the poor. The woman of the house swore like a carter, and
was always dishevelled and disorderly: this did not prevent
Rousseau from recognising her kindness of heart and her staunch
readiness to befriend. He passed his days in wandering about the
streets of Turin, seeing the wonders of a capital, and expecting
some adventure that should raise him to unknown heights. He went
regularly to mass, watched the pomp of the court, and counted upon
stirring a passion in the breast of a princess. &#192; more
important circumstance was the effect of the mass in awakening in
his own breast his latent passion for music; a passion so strong
that the poorest instrument, if it were only in tune, never failed
to give him the liveliest pleasure. The king of Sardinia was
believed to have the best performers in Europe; less than that was
enough to quicken the musical susceptibility which is perhaps an
invariable element in the most completely sensuous natures.</p>
<p>When the end of the twenty francs began to seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.39" id="Page_i.39">[i.39]</a></span>
 a thing
possible, he tried to get work as an engraver. A young woman in a
shop took pity on him, gave him work and food, and perhaps
permitted him to make dumb and grovelling love to her, until her
husband returned home and drove her client away from the door with
threats and the waving of a wand not magical.<a name="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31">[31]</a> Rousseau's
self-love sought an explanation in the natural fury of an Italian
husband's jealousy; but we need hardly ask for any other cause than
a shopkeeper's reasonable objection to vagabonds.</p>
<p>The next step of this youth, who was always dreaming of the love
of princesses, was to accept with just thankfulness the position of
lackey or footboy in the household of a widow. With Madame de
Vercellis he passed three months, and at the end of that time she
died. His stay here was marked by an incident that has filled many
pages with stormful discussion. When Madame de Vercellis died, a
piece of old rose-coloured ribbon was missing; Rousseau had stolen
it, and it was found in his possession. They asked him whence he
had taken it. He replied that it had been given to him by Marion, a
young and comely maid in the house. In her presence and before the
whole household he repeated his false story, and clung to it with a
bitter effrontery that we may well call diabolic, remembering how
the nervous terror of punishment and exposure sinks the angel in
man. Our phrase, want of moral courage, really denotes in the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.40" id="Page_i.40">[i.40]</a></span>
an excruciating physical struggle, often so keen that the victim
clutches after liberation with the spontaneous tenacity and cruelty
of a creature wrecked in mastering waters. Undisciplined sensations
constitute egoism in the most ruthless of its shapes, and at this
epoch, owing either to the brutalities which surrounded his
apprentice life at Geneva, or to that rapid tendency towards
degeneration which he suspected in his own character, Rousseau was
the slave of sensations which stained his days with baseness.
&quot;Never,&quot; he says, in his account of this hateful action, &quot;was
wickedness further from me than at this cruel moment; and when I
accused the poor girl, it is contradictory and yet it is true that
my affection for her was the cause of what I did. She was present
to my mind, and I threw the blame from myself on to the first
object that presented itself. When I saw her appear my heart was
torn, but the presence of so many people was too strong for my
remorse. I feared punishment very little; I only feared disgrace,
but I feared that more than death, more than crime, more than
anything in the world. I would fain have buried myself in the
depths of the earth; invincible shame prevailed over all, shame
alone caused my effrontery, and the more criminal I became, the
more intrepid was I made by the fright of confessing it. I could
see nothing but the horror of being recognised and declared
publicly to my face a thief, liar, and traducer.&quot;<a name="FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32">[32]</a> When he says
that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.41" id="Page_i.41">[i.41]</a></span> feared punishment little, his analysis of his mind is most
likely wrong, for nothing is clearer than that a dread of
punishment in any physical form was a peculiarly strong feeling
with him at this time. However that may have been, the same
over-excited imagination which put every sense on the alarm and led
him into so abominable a misdemeanour, brought its own penalties.
It led him to conceive a long train of ruin as having befallen
Marion in consequence of his calumny against her, and this dreadful
thought haunted him to the end of his life. In the long sleepless
nights he thought he saw the unhappy girl coming to reproach him
with a crime that seemed as fresh to him as if it had been
perpetrated the day before.<a name="FNanchor33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33">[33]</a> Thus the same brooding memory which
brought back to him the sweet pain of his gentle kinswoman's
household melody, preserved the darker side of his history with
equal fidelity and no less perfect continuousness. Rousseau
expresses a hope and belief that this burning remorse would serve
as expiation for his fault; as if expiation for the destruction of
another soul could be anything but a fine name for self-absolution.
We may, however, charitably and reasonably think that the possible
consequences of his fault to the unfortunate Marion were not
actual, but were as much a hallucination as the midnight visits of
her reproachful spirit. Indeed, we are hardly condoning evil, in
suggesting that the whole story from its beginning is marked with
exag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.42" id="Page_i.42">[i.42]</a></span>geration, and that we who have our own lives to lead shall find
little help in criticising at further length the exact heinousness
of the ignoble falsehood of a boy who happened to grow up into a
man of genius.<a name="FNanchor34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34">[34]</a></p>
<p>After an interval of six weeks, which were passed in the garret
or cellar of his rough patroness with kind heart and ungentle
tongue, Rousseau again found himself a lackey in the house of a
Piedmontese person of quality. This new master, the Count of
Gouvon, treated him with a certain unusual considerateness, which
may perhaps make us doubt the narrative. His son condescended to
teach the youth Latin, and Rousseau presumed to entertain a passion
for one of the daughters of the house, to whom he paid silent
homage in the odd shape of attending to her wants at table with
special solicitude. In this situation he had, or at least he
supposed that he had, an excellent chance of ultimate advancement.
But advancement here or elsewhere means a measure of stability, and
Rousseau's temperament in his youth was the archtype of the
mutable. An old comrade from Geneva visited him,<a name="FNanchor35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35">[35]</a> and as almost any
incident is stimulating enough to fire the restlessness of
imaginative youth, the gratitude which he professed to the Count of
Gouvon and his family, the prudence with which he marked his
prospects, the industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.43" id="Page_i.43">[i.43]</a></span> with which he profited by opportunity, all
faded quickly into mere dead and disembodied names of virtues. His
imagination again went over the journey across the mountains; the
fields, the woods, the streams, began to absorb his whole life. He
recalled with delicious satisfaction how charming the journey had
seemed to him, and thought how far more charming it would be in the
society of a comrade of his own age and taste, without duty, or
constraint, or obligation to go or stay other than as it might
please them. &quot;It would be madness to sacrifice such a piece of good
fortune to projects of ambition, which were slow, difficult,
doubtful of execution, and which, even if they should one day be
realised, were not with all their glory worth a quarter of an hour
of true pleasure and freedom in youth.&quot;<a name="FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>On these high principles he neglected his duties so recklessly
that he was dismissed from his situation, and he and his comrade
began their homeward wanderings with more than apostolic
heedlessness as to what they should eat or wherewithal they should
be clothed. They had a toy fountain; they hoped that in return for
the amusement to be conferred by this wonder they should receive
all that they might need. Their hopes were not fulfilled. The
exhibition of the toy fountain did not excuse them from their
reckoning. Before long it was accidentally broken, and to their
secret satisfaction, for it had lost its novelty. Their naked,
vagrancy was thus undisguised. They made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.44" id="Page_i.44">[i.44]</a></span> their way by some means or
other across the mountains, and their enjoyment of vagabondage was
undisturbed by any thought of a future. &quot;To understand my delirium
at this moment,&quot; Rousseau says, in words which shed much light on
darker parts of his history than fits of vagrancy, &quot;it is necessary
to know to what a degree my heart is subject to get aflame with the
smallest things, and with what force it plunges into the
imagination of the object that attracts it, vain as that object may
be. The most grotesque, the most childish, the maddest schemes come
to caress my favourite idea, and to show me the reasonableness of
surrendering myself to it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37">[37]</a> It was this deep internal vehemence which
distinguished Rousseau all through his life from the commonplace
type of social revolter. A vagrant sensuous temperament, strangely
compounded with Genevese austerity; an ardent and fantastic
imagination, incongruously shot with threads of firm reason; too
little conscience and too much; a monstrous and diseased love of
self, intertwined with a sincere compassion and keen interest for
the great fellowship of his brothers; a wild dreaming of dreams
that were made to look like sanity by the close and specious
connection between conclusions and premisses, though the premisses
happened to have the fault of being profoundly unreal:&#8212;this was
the type of character that lay unfolded in the youth who, towards
the autumn of 1729, reached Annecy, penni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.45" id="Page_i.45">[i.45]</a></span>less and ragged, throwing
himself once more on the charity of the patroness who had given him
shelter eighteen months before. Few figures in the world at that
time were less likely to conciliate the favour or excite the
interest of an observer, who had not studied the hidden
convolutions of human character deeply enough to know that a boy of
eighteen may be sly, sensual, restless, dreamy, and yet have it in
him to say things one day which may help to plunge a world into
conflagration.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III."></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>SAVOY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> commonplace theory which the world takes for granted as to
the relations of the sexes, makes the woman ever crave the power
and guidance of her physically stronger mate. Even if this be a
true account of the normal state, there is at any rate a kind of
temperament among the many types of men, in which it seems as if
the elements of character remain mere futile and dispersive
particles, until compelled into unity and organisation by the
creative shock of feminine influence. There are men, famous or
obscure, whose lives might be divided into a number of epochs, each
defined and presided over by the influence of a woman. For the
inconstant such a calendar contains many divisions, for the
constant it is brief and simple; for both alike it marks the great
decisive phases through which character has moved.</p>
<p>Rousseau's temperament was deeply marked by this special sort of
susceptibility in one of its least agreeable forms. His sentiment
was neither robustly and courageously animal, nor was it an
intellectual demand for the bright and vivacious sympathies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.47" id="Page_i.47">[i.47]</a></span>
which women sometimes excel. It had neither bold virility, nor that
sociable energy which makes close emotional companionship an
essential condition of freedom of faculty and completeness of work.
There is a certain close and sickly air round all his dealings with
women and all his feeling for them. We seem to move not in the
star-like radiance of love, nor even in the fiery flames of lust,
but among the humid heats of some unknown abode of things not
wholesome or manly. &quot;I know a sentiment,&quot; he writes, &quot;which is
perhaps less impetuous than love, but a thousand times more
delicious, which sometimes is joined to love, and which is very
often apart from it. Nor is this sentiment friendship only; it is
more voluptuous, more tender; I do not believe that any one of the
same sex could be its object; at least I have been a friend, if
ever man was, and I never felt this about any of my friends.&quot;<a name="FNanchor38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38">[38]</a> He admits that
he can only describe this sentiment by its effects; but our lives
are mostly ruled by elements that defy definition, and in
Rousseau's case the sentiment which he could not describe was a
paramount trait of his mental constitution. It was as a voluptuous
garment; in it his imagination was cherished into activity, and
protected against that outer air of reality which braces ordinary
men, but benumbs and disintegrates the whole vital apparatus of
such an organisation as Rousseau's. If he had been devoid of this
feeling about women, his character might very possibly have
remained sterile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.48" id="Page_i.48">[i.48]</a></span> That feeling was the complementary contribution,
without which could be no fecundity.</p>
<p>When he returned from his squalid Italian expedition in search
of bread and a new religion, his mind was clouded with the vague
desire, the sensual moodiness, which in such natures stains the
threshold of manhood. This unrest, with its mysterious torments and
black delights, was banished, or at least soothed into a happier
humour, by the influence of a person who is one of the most
striking types to be found in the gallery of fair women.</p>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>A French writer in the eighteenth century, in a story which
deals with a rather repulsive theme of action in a tone that is
graceful, simple, and pathetic, painted the portrait of a creature
for whom no moralist with a reputation to lose can say a word; and
we may, if we choose, fool ourselves by supposing her to be without
a counterpart in the better-regulated world of real life, but, in
spite of both these objections, she is an interesting and not
untouching figure to those who like to know all the many-webbed
stuff out of which their brothers and sisters are made. The Manon
Lescaut of the unfortunate Abb&#233; Prevost, kindly, bright,
playful, tender, but devoid of the very germ of the idea of that
virtue which is counted the sovereign recommendation of woman,
helps us to understand Madame de Warens. There are differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.49" id="Page_i.49">[i.49]</a></span>ences
enough between them, and we need not mistake them for one and the
same type. Manon Lescaut is a prettier figure, because romance has
fewer limitations than real life; but if we think of her in reading
of Rousseau's benefactress, the vision of the imaginary woman tends
to soften our judgment of the actual one, as well as to enlighten
our conception of a character that eludes the instruments of a
commonplace analysis.<a name="FNanchor39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>She was born at Vevai in 1700; she married early, and early
disagreed with her husband, from whom she eventually went away,
abandoning family, religion, country, and means of subsistence,
with all gaiety of heart. The King of Sardinia happened to be
keeping his court at a small town on the southern shores of the
lake of Geneva, and the conversion of Madame de Warens to
Catholicism by the preaching of the Bishop of Annecy,<a name="FNanchor40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40">[40]</a> gave a zest to
the royal visit, as being a successful piece of sport in that great
spiritual hunt which Savoy loved to pursue at the expense of the
reformed church in Switzerland. The king, to mark his zeal for the
faith of his house, conferred on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.50" id="Page_i.50">[i.50]</a></span> the new convert a small pension
for life; but as the tongues of the scandalous imputed a less pure
motive for such generosity in a parsimonious prince, Madame de
Warens removed from the court and settled at Annecy. Her conversion
was hardly more serious than Rousseau's own, because seriousness
was no condition of her intelligence on any of its sides or in any
of its relations. She was extremely charitable to the poor, full of
pity for all in misfortune, easily moved to forgiveness of wrong or
ingratitude; careless, gay, open-hearted; having, in a word, all
the good qualities which spring in certain generous soils from
human impulse, and hardly any of those which spring from
reflection, or are implanted by the ordering of society. Her reason
had been warped in her youth by an instructor of the devil's
stamp;&quot;<a name="FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41">[41]</a>
finding her attached to her husband and to her duties, always cold,
argumentative, and impregnable on the side of the senses, he
attacked her by sophisms, and at last persuaded her that the union
of the sexes is in itself a matter of the most perfect
indifference, provided only that decorum of appearance be
preserved, and the peace of mind of persons concerned be not
disturbed.<a name="FNanchor42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42">[42]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.51" id="Page_i.51">[i.51]</a></span>
This execrable lesson, which greater and more unselfish men held
and propagated in grave books before the end of the century, took
root in her mind. If we accept Rousseau's explanation, it did so
the more easily as her temperament was cold, and thus corroborated
the idea of the indifference of what public opinion and private
passion usually concur in investing with such enormous weightiness.
&quot;I will even dare to say,&quot; Rousseau declares, &quot;that she only knew
one true pleasure in the world, and that was to give pleasure to
those whom she loved.&quot;<a name="FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43">[43]</a> He is at great pains to protest how
compatible this coolness of temperament is with excessive
sensibility of character; and neither ethological theory nor
practical observation of men and women is at all hostile to what he
is so anxious to prove. The cardinal element of character is the
speed at which its energies move; its rapidity or its steadiness,
concentration or volatility; whether the thought and feeling travel
as quickly as light or as slowly as sound. A rapid and volatile
constitution like that of Madame de Warens is inconsistent with
ardent and glowing warmth, which belongs to the other sort, but it
is essentially bound up with sensibility, or readiness of
sympathetic answer to every cry from another soul. It is the slow,
brooding, smouldering nature, like Rousseau's own, in which we may
expect to find the tropics.</p>
<p>To bring the heavy artillery of moral reprobation to bear upon a
poor soul like Madame de Warens is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.52" id="Page_i.52">[i.52]</a></span> as if one should denounce
flagrant want of moral purpose in the busy movements of ephemera.
Her activity was incessant, but it ended in nothing better than
debt, embarrassment, and confusion. She inherited from her father a
taste for alchemy, and spent much time in search after secret
elixirs and the like. &quot;Quacks, taking advantage of her weakness,
made themselves her master, constantly infested her, ruined her,
and wasted, in the midst of furnaces and chemicals, intelligence,
talents, and charms which would have made her the delight of the
best societies.&quot;<a name="FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44">[44]</a> Perhaps, however, the too notorious
vagrancy of her amours had at least as much to do with her failure
to delight the best societies as her indiscreet passion for
alchemy. Her person was attractive enough. &quot;She had those points of
beauty,&quot; says Rousseau, &quot;which are desirable, because they reside
rather in expression than in feature. She had a tender and
caressing air, a soft eye, a divine smile, light hair of uncommon
beauty. You could not see a finer head or bosom, finer arms or
hands.&quot;<a name="FNanchor45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45">[45]</a> She
was full of tricks and whimsies. She could not endure the first
smell of the soup and meats at dinner; when they were placed on the
table she nearly swooned, and her disgust lasted some time, until
at the end of half an hour or so she took her first morsel.<a name="FNanchor46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46">[46]</a> On the whole, if
we accept the current standard of sanity, Madame de Warens must be
pronounced ever so little flighty; but a monotonous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.53" id="Page_i.53">[i.53]</a></span> world can
afford to be lenient to people with a slight craziness, if it only
has hearty benevolence and cheerfulness in its company, and is free
from egoism or rapacious vanity.</p>
<p>This was the person within the sphere of whose attraction
Rousseau was decisively brought in the autumn of 1729, and he
remained, with certain breaks of vagabondage, linked by a close
attachment to her until 1738. It was in many respects the truly
formative portion of his life. He acquired during this time much of
his knowledge of books, such as it was, and his principles of
judging them. He saw much of the lives of the poor and of the
world's ways with them. Above all his ideal was revolutionised, and
the recent dreams of Plutarchian heroism, of grandeur, of palaces,
princesses, and a glorious career full in the world's eye, were
replaced by a new conception of blessedness of life, which never
afterwards faded from his vision, and which has held a front place
in the imagination of literary Europe ever since. The notions or
aspirations which he had picked up from a few books gave way to
notions and aspirations which were shaped and fostered by the
scenes of actual life into which he was thrown, and which found his
character soft for their impression. In one way the new pictures of
a future were as dissociated from the conditions of reality as the
old had been, and the sensuous life of the happy valley in Savoy as
little fitted a man to compose ideals for our gnarled and knotted
world as the mental life among the heroics of sentimental fiction
had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.54" id="Page_i.54">[i.54]</a></span></p>

<p>Rousseau's delight in the spot where Madame de Warens lived at
Annecy was the mark of the new ideal which circumstances were to
engender in him, and after him to spread in many hearts. His room
looked over gardens and a stream, and beyond them stretched a far
landscape. &quot;It was the first time since leaving Bossey that I had
green before my windows. Always shut in by walls, I had nothing
under my eye but house-tops and the dull gray of the streets. How
moving and delicious this novelty was to me! It brightened all the
tenderness of my disposition. I counted the landscape among the
kindnesses of my dear benefactress; it seemed as if she had brought
it there expressly for me. I placed myself there in all
peacefulness with her; she was present to me everywhere among the
flowers and the verdure; her charms and those of spring were all
mingled together in my eyes. My heart, which had hitherto been
stifled, found itself more free in this ample space, and my sighs
had more liberal vent among these orchard gardens.&quot;<a name="FNanchor47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47">[47]</a> Madame de Warens
was the semi-divine figure who made the scene live, and gave it
perfect and harmonious accent. He had neither transports nor
desires by her side, but existed in a state of ravishing calm,
enjoying without knowing what. &quot;I could have passed my whole life
and eternity itself in this way, without an instant of weariness.
She is the only person with whom I never felt that dryness in
conversation, which turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.55" id="Page_i.55">[i.55]</a></span> the duty of keeping it up into a torment.
Our intercourse was not so much conversation as an inexhaustible
stream of chatter, which never came to an end until it was
interrupted from without. I only felt all the force of my
attachment for her when she was out of my sight. So long as I could
see her I was merely happy and satisfied, but my disquiet in her
absence went so far as to be painful. I shall never forget how one
holiday, while she was at vespers, I went for a walk outside the
town, my heart full of her image and of an eager desire to pass all
my days by her side. I had sense enough to see that for the present
this was impossible, and that the bliss which I relished so keenly
must be brief. This gave to my musing a sadness which was free from
everything sombre, and which was moderated by pleasing hope. The
sound of the bells, which has always moved me to a singular degree,
the singing of the birds, the glory of the weather, the sweetness
of the landscape, the scattered rustic dwellings in which my
imagination placed our common home;&#8212;all this so struck me with a
vivid, tender, sad, and touching impression that I saw myself as in
an ecstasy transported into the happy time and the happy place
where my heart, possessed of all the felicity that could bring it
delight, without even dreaming of the pleasures of sense, should
share joys inexpressible.&quot;<a name="FNanchor48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>There was still, however, a space to be bridged between the
doubtful now and this delicious future.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.56" id="Page_i.56">[i.56]</a></span> The harshness of
circumstance is ever interposing with a money question, and for a
vagrant of eighteen the first of all problems is a problem of
economics. Rousseau was submitted to the observation of a kinsman
of Madame de Warens,<a name="FNanchor49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49">[49]</a> and his verdict corresponded with that of
the notary of Geneva, with whom years before Rousseau had first
tried the critical art of making a living. He pronounced that in
spite of an animated expression, the lad was, if not thoroughly
inept, at least of very slender intelligence, without ideas, almost
without attainments, very narrow indeed in all respects, and that
the honour of one day becoming a village priest was the highest
piece of fortune to which he had any right to aspire.<a name="FNanchor50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50">[50]</a> So he was sent to
the seminary, to learn Latin enough for the priestly offices. He
began by conceiving a deadly antipathy to his instructor, whose
appearance happened to be displeasing to him. A second was
found,<a name="FNanchor51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51">[51]</a> and
the patient and obliging temper, the affectionate and sympathetic
manner of his new teacher made a great impression on the pupil,
though the progress in intellectual acquirement was as
unsatisfactory in one case as in the other. It is characteristic of
that subtle impressionableness to physical comeliness, which in
ordinary natures is rapidly effaced by press of more urgent
considerations, but which Rousseau's strongly sensuous quality
retained, that he should have remembered, and thought worth
mentioning years afterwards, that the first of his two teachers at
the seminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.57" id="Page_i.57">[i.57]</a></span> of Annecy had greasy black hair, a complexion as of
gingerbread, and bristles in place of beard, while the second had
the most touching expression he ever saw in his life, with fair
hair and large blue eyes, and a glance and a tone which made you
feel that he was one of the band predestined from their birth to
unhappy days. While at Turin, Rousseau had made the acquaintance of
another sage and benevolent priest,<a name="FNanchor52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52">[52]</a> and uniting the two good men thirty years
after he conceived and drew the character of the Savoyard
Vicar.<a name="FNanchor53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53">[53]</a></p>
<p>Shortly the seminarists reported that, though not vicious, their
pupil was not even good enough for a priest, so deficient was he in
intellectual faculty. It was next decided to try music, and
Rousseau ascended for a brief space into the seventh heaven of the
arts. This was one of the intervals of his life of which he says
that he recalls not only the times, places, persons, but all the
surrounding objects, the temperature of the air, its odour, its
colour, a certain local impression only felt there, and the memory
of which stirs the old transports anew. He never forgot a certain
tune, because one Advent Sunday he heard it from his bed being sung
before daybreak on the steps of the cathedral; nor an old lame
carpenter who played the counter-bass, nor a fair little
abb&#233; who played the violin in the choir.<a name="FNanchor54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54">[54]</a> Yet he was in so
dreamy, absent, and distracted a state, that neither his good-will
nor his assiduity availed, and he could learn nothing, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.58" id="Page_i.58">[i.58]</a></span> even
music. His teacher, one Le M&#226;itre, belonged to that great
class of irregular and disorderly natures with which Rousseau's
destiny, in the shape of an irregular and disorderly temperament of
his own, so constantly brought him into contact. Le M&#226;itre
could not work without the inspiration of the wine cup, and thus
his passion for his art landed him a sot. He took offence at a
slight put upon him by the precentor of the cathedral of which he
was choir-master, and left Annecy in a furtive manner along with
Rousseau, whom the too comprehensive solicitude of Madame de Warens
despatched to bear him company. They went together as far as Lyons;
here the unfortunate musician happened to fall into an epileptic
fit in the street. Rousseau called for help, informed the crowd of
the poor man's hotel, and then seizing a moment when no one was
thinking about him, turned the street corner and finally
disappeared, the musician being thus &quot;abandoned by the only friend
on whom he had a right to count.&quot;<a name="FNanchor55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55">[55]</a> It thus appears that a man maybe
exquisitely moved by the sound of bells, the song of birds, the
fairness of smiling gardens, and yet be capable all the time
without a qualm of misgiving of leaving a friend senseless in the
road in a strange place. It has ceased to be wonderful how many
ugly and cruel actions are done by people with an extraordinary
sense of the beauty and beneficence of nature. At the moment
Rousseau only thought of getting back to Annecy and Madame de
Warens. &quot;It is not,&quot; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.59" id="Page_i.59">[i.59]</a></span> says in words of profound warning, which
many men have verified in those two or three hours before the tardy
dawn that swell into huge purgatorial &#230;ons,&#8212;&quot;it is not when
we have just done a bad action, that it torments us; it is when we
recall it long after, for the memory of it can never be thrust
out.&quot;<a name="FNanchor56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56">[56]</a></p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>When he made his way homewards again, he found to his surprise
and dismay that his benefactress had left Annecy, and had gone for
an indefinite time to Paris. He never knew the secret of this
sudden departure, for no man, he says, was ever so little curious
as to the private affairs of his friends. His heart, completely
occupied with the present, filled its whole capacity and entire
space with that, and except for past pleasures no empty corner was
ever left for what was done with.<a name="FNanchor57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57">[57]</a> He says he was too young to take the
desertion deeply to heart. Where he found subsistence we do not
know. He was fascinated by a flashy French adventurer,<a name="FNanchor58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58">[58]</a> in whose company
he wasted many hours, and the precious stuff of youthful
opportunity. He passed a summer day in joyful rustic fashion with
two damsels whom he hardly ever saw again, but the memory of whom
and of the holiday that they had made with him remained stamped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.60" id="Page_i.60">[i.60]</a></span>
his brain, to be reproduced many a year hence in some of the traits
of the new Helo&#239;sa and her friend Claire.<a name="FNanchor59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59">[59]</a> Then he accepted
an invitation from a former waiting-woman of Madame de Warens to
attend her home to Freiburg. On this expedition he paid an hour's
visit to his father, who had settled and remarried at Nyon.
Returning from Freiburg, he came to Lausanne, where, with an
audacity that might be taken for the first presage of mental
disturbance, he undertook to teach music. &quot;I have already,&quot; he
says, &quot;noted some moments of inconceivable delirium, in which I
ceased to be myself. Behold me now a teacher of singing, without
knowing how to decipher an air. Without the least knowledge of
composition, I boasted of my skill in it before all the world; and
without ability to score the slenderest vaudeville, I gave myself
out for a composer. Having been presented to M. de Treytorens, a
professor of law, who loved music and gave concerts at his house, I
insisted on giving him a specimen of my talent, and I set to work
to compose a piece for his concert with as much effrontery as if I
knew all about it.&quot; The performance came off duly, and the strange
impostor conducted it with as much gravity as the profoundest
master. Never since the beginning of opera has the like charivari
greeted the ears of men.<a name="FNanchor60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60">[60]</a> Such an opening was fatal to all chance of
scholars, but the friendly tavern-keeper who had first taken him in
did not lack either hope or charity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.61" id="Page_i.61">[i.61]</a></span> &quot;How is it,&quot; Rousseau cried,
many years after this, &quot;that having found so many good people in my
youth, I find so few in my advanced life? Is their stock exhausted?
No; but the class in which I have to seek them now is not the same
as that in which I found them then. Among the common people, where
great passions only speak at intervals, the sentiments of nature
make themselves heard oftener. In the higher ranks they are
absolutely stifled, and under the mask of sentiment it is only
interest or vanity that speaks.&quot;<a name="FNanchor61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61">[61]</a></p>
<p>From Lausanne he went to Neuch&#226;tel, where he had more
success, for, teaching others, he began himself to learn. But no
success was marked enough to make him resist a vagrant chance. One
day in his rambles falling in with an archimandrite of the Greek
church, who was traversing Europe in search of subscriptions for
the restoration of the Holy Sepulchre, he at once attached himself
to him in the capacity of interpreter. In this position he remained
for a few weeks, until the French minister at Soleure took him away
from the Greek monk, and despatched him to Paris to be the
attendant of a young officer.<a name="FNanchor62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62">[62]</a> A few days in the famous city, which he
now saw for the first time, and which disappointed his expecta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.62" id="Page_i.62">[i.62]</a></span>tions
just as the sea and all other wonders disappointed them,<a name="FNanchor63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63">[63]</a> convinced him
that here was not what he sought, and he again turned his face
southwards in search of Madame de Warens and more familiar
lands.</p>
<p>The interval thus passed in roaming over the eastern face of
France, and which we may date in the summer of 1732,<a name="FNanchor64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64">[64]</a> was always
counted by Rousseau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.63" id="Page_i.63">[i.63]</a></span> among the happy epochs of his life, though the
weeks may seem grievously wasted to a generation which is apt to
limit its ideas of redeeming the time to the two pursuits of
reading books or making money. He travelled alone and on foot from
Soleure to Paris and from Paris back again to Lyons, and this was
part of the training which served him in the stead of books.
Scarcely any great writer since the revival of letters has been so
little literary as Rousseau, so little indebted to literature for
the most characteristic part of his work. He was formed by life;
not by life in the sense of contact with a great number of active
and important persons, or with a great number of persons of any
kind, but in the rarer sense of free surrender to the plenitude of
his own impressions. A world composed of such people, all
dispensing with the inherited portion of human experience, and
living independently on their own stock, would rapidly fall
backwards into dissolution. But there is no more rash idea of the
right composition of a society than one which leads us to denounce
a type of character for no better reason than that, if it were
universal, society would go to pieces. There is very little danger
of Rousseau's type becoming common, unless lunar or other great
physical influences arise to work a vast change in the cerebral
constitution of the species. We may safely trust the prodigious
<i>vis inertioe</i> of human nature to ward off the peril of an
eccentricity beyond bounds spreading too far. At present, however,
it is enough, without going into the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.64" id="Page_i.64">[i.64]</a></span> question, to notice
the particular fact that while the other great exponents of the
eighteenth century movement, Hume, Voltaire, Diderot, were
nourishing their natural strength of understanding by the study and
practice of literature, Rousseau, the leader of the reaction
against that movement, was wandering a beggar and an outcast,
craving the rude fare of the peasant's hut, knocking at roadside
inns, and passing nights in caves and holes in the fields, or in
the great desolate streets of towns.</p>
<p>If such a life had been disagreeable to him, it would have lost
all the significance that it now has for us. But where others would
have found affliction, he had consolation, and where they would
have lain desperate and squalid, he marched elate and ready to
strike the stars. &quot;Never,&quot; he says, &quot;did I think so much, exist so
much, be myself so much, as in the journeys that I have made alone
and on foot. Walking has something about it which animates and
enlivens my ideas. I can hardly think while I am still; my body
must be in motion, to move my mind. The sight of the country, the
succession of agreeable views, open air, good appetite, the freedom
of the alehouse, the absence of everything that could make me feel
dependence, or recall me to my situation&#8212;all this sets my soul
free, gives me a greater boldness of thought. I dispose of all
nature as its sovereign lord; my heart, wandering from object to
object, mingles and is one with the things that soothe it, wraps
itself up in charming images, and is intoxi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.65" id="Page_i.65">[i.65]</a></span>cated by delicious
sentiment. Ideas come as they please, not as I please: they do not
come at all, or they come in a crowd, overwhelming me with their
number and their force. When I came to a place I only thought of
eating, and when I left it I only thought of walking. I felt that a
new paradise awaited me at the door, and I thought of nothing but
of hastening in search of it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65">[65]</a></p>
<p>Here again is a picture of one whom vagrancy assuredly did not
degrade:&#8212;&quot;I had not the least care for the future, and I awaited
the answer [as to the return of Madame de Warens to Savoy], lying
out in the open air, sleeping stretched out on the ground or on
some wooden bench, as tranquilly as on a bed of roses. I remember
passing one delicious night outside the town [Lyons], in a road
which ran by the side of either the Rhone or the Sa&#244;ne, I
forget which of the two. Gardens raised on a terrace bordered the
other side of the road. It had been very hot all day, and the
evening was delightful; the dew moistened the parched grass, the
night was profoundly still, the air fresh without being cold; the
sun in going down had left red vapours in the heaven, and they
turned the water to rose colour; the trees on the terrace sheltered
nightingales, answering song for song. I went on in a sort of
ecstasy, surrendering my heart and every sense to the enjoyment of
it all, and only sighing for regret that I was enjoying it alone.
Absorbed in the sweetness of my musing, I prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.66" id="Page_i.66">[i.66]</a></span> my ramble far
into the night, without ever perceiving that I was tired. At last I
found it out. I lay down luxuriously on the shelf of a niche or
false doorway made in the wall of the terrace; the canopy of my bed
was formed by overarching tree-tops; a nightingale was perched
exactly over my head, and I fell asleep to his singing. My slumber
was delicious, my awaking more delicious still. It was broad day,
and my opening eyes looked on sun and water and green things, and
an adorable landscape. I rose up and gave myself a shake; I felt
hungry and started gaily for the town, resolved to spend on a good
breakfast the two pieces of money which I still had left. I was in
such joyful spirits that I went along the road singing
lustily.&quot;<a name="FNanchor66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66">[66]</a></p>
<p>There is in this the free expansion of inner sympathy; the
natural sentiment spontaneously responding to all the delicious
movement of the external world on its peaceful and harmonious side,
just as if the world of many-hued social circumstance which man has
made for himself had no existence. We are conscious of a full
nervous elation which is not the product of literature, such as we
have seen so many a time since, and which only found its expression
in literature in Rousseau's case by accident. He did not feel in
order to write, but felt without any thought of writing. He dreamed
at this time of many lofty destinies, among them that of marshal of
France, but the fame of authorship never entered into his dreams.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.67" id="Page_i.67">[i.67]</a></span>
When the time for authorship actually came, his work had all the
benefit of the absence of self-consciousness, it had all the
disinterestedness, so to say, with which the first fresh
impressions were suffered to rise in his mind.</p>
<p>One other picture of this time is worth remembering, as showing
that Rousseau was not wholly blind to social circumstances, and as
illustrating, too, how it was that his way of dealing with them was
so much more real and passionate, though so much less sagacious in
some of its aspects, than the way of the other revolutionists of
the century. One day, when he had lost himself in wandering in
search of some site which he expected to find beautiful, he entered
the house of a peasant, half dead with hunger and thirst. His
entertainer offered him nothing more restoring than coarse barley
bread and skimmed milk. Presently, after seeing what manner of
guest he had, the worthy man descended by a small trap into his
cellar, and brought up some good brown bread, some meat, and a
bottle of wine, and an omelette was added afterwards. Then he
explained to the wondering Rousseau, who was a Swiss, and knew none
of the mysteries of the French fisc, that he hid away his wine on
account of the duties, and his bread on account of the
<i>taille</i>, and declared that he would be a ruined man if they
suspected that he was not dying of hunger. All this made an
impression on Rousseau which he never forgot. &quot;Here,&quot; he says, &quot;was
the germ of the inextinguishable hatred which afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.68" id="Page_i.68">[i.68]</a></span> grew up in
my heart against the vexations that harass the common people, and
against all their oppressors. This man actually did not dare to eat
the bread which he had won by the sweat of his brow, and only
avoided ruin by showing the same misery as reigned around
him.&quot;<a name="FNanchor67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67">[67]</a></p>
<p>It was because he had thus seen the wrongs of the poor, not from
without but from within, not as a pitying spectator but as of their
own company, that Rousseau by and by brought such fire to the
attack upon the old order, and changed the blank practice of the
elder philosophers into a deadly affair of ball and shell. The man
who had been a servant, who had wanted bread, who knew the horrors
of the midnight street, who had slept in dens, who had been
befriended by rough men and rougher women, who saw the goodness of
humanity under its coarsest outside, and who above all never tried
to shut these things out from his memory, but accepted them as the
most interesting, the most touching, the most real of all his
experiences, might well be expected to penetrate to the root of the
matter, and to protest to the few who usurp literature and policy
with their ideas, aspirations, interests, that it is not they but
the many, whose existence stirs the heart and fills the eye with
the great prime elements of the human lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.69" id="Page_i.69">[i.69]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>
<p>It was, then, some time towards the middle of 1732 that Rousseau
arrived at Chamb&#233;ri, and finally took up his residence with
Madame de Warens, in the dullest and most sombre room of a dull and
sombre house. She had procured him employment in connection with a
land survey which the government of Charles Emmanuel III. was then
executing. It was only temporary, and Rousseau's function was no
loftier than that of clerk, who had to copy and reduce arithmetical
calculations. We may imagine how little a youth fresh from nights
under the summer sky would relish eight hours a day of surly toil
in a gloomy office, with a crowd of dirty and ill-smelling
fellow-workers.<a name="FNanchor68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68">[68]</a> If Rousseau was ever oppressed by any set
of circumstances, his method was invariable: he ran away from them.
So now he threw up his post, and again tried to earn a little money
by that musical instruction in which he had made so many singular
and grotesque endeavours. Even here the virtues which make ordinary
life a possible thing were not his. He was pleased at his lessons
while there, but he could not bear the idea of being bound to be
there, nor the fixing of an hour. In time this experiment for a
subsistence came to the same end as all the others. He next rushed
to Besan&#231;on in search of the musical instruction which he
wished to give to others, but his baggage was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.70" id="Page_i.70">[i.70]</a></span> confiscated at the
frontier, and he had to return.<a name="FNanchor69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69">[69]</a> Finally he abandoned the attempt, and
threw himself loyally upon the narrow resources of Madame de
Warens, whom he assisted in some singularly indefinite way in the
transaction of her very indefinite and miscellaneous affairs,&#8212;if
we are here, as so often, to give the name of affairs to a very
rapid and heedless passage along a shabby road to ruin.</p>
<p>The household at this time was on a very remarkable footing.
Madame de Warens was at its head, and Claude Anet, gardener,
butler, steward, was her factotum. He was a discreet person, of
severe probity and few words, firm, thrifty, and sage. The too
comprehensive principles of his mistress admitted him to the
closest intimacy, and in due time, when Madame de Warens thought of
the seductions which ensnare the feet of youth, Rousseau was
delivered from them in an equivocal way by solicitous application
of the same maxims of comprehension. &quot;Although Claude Anet was as
young as she was, he was so mature and so grave, that he looked
upon us as two children worthy of indulgence, and we both looked
upon him as a respectable man, whose esteem it was our business to
conciliate. Thus there grew up between us three a companionship,
perhaps without another example like it upon earth. All our wishes,
our cares, our hearts were in common; nothing seemed to pass
outside our little circle. The habit of living together, and of
living together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.71" id="Page_i.71">[i.71]</a></span> exclusively, became so strong that if at our meals
one of the three was absent, or there came a fourth, all was thrown
out; and in spite of our peculiar relations, a
<i>t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te</i> was less sweet than a meeting
of all three.&quot;<a name="FNanchor70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70">[70]</a> Fate interfered to spoil this striking
attempt after a new type of the family, developed on a duandric
base. Claude Anet was seized with illness, a consequence of
excessive fatigue in an Alpine expedition in search of plants, and
he came to his end.<a name="FNanchor71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71">[71]</a> In him Rousseau always believed that he
lost the most solid friend he ever possessed, &quot;a rare and estimable
man, in whom nature served instead of education, and who nourished
in obscure servitude all the virtues of great men.&quot;<a name="FNanchor72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72">[72]</a> The day after
his death, Rousseau was speaking of their lost friend to Madame de
Warens with the liveliest and most sincere affliction, when
suddenly in the midst of the conversation he remembered that he
should inherit the poor man's clothes, and particularly a handsome
black coat. A reproachful tear from his Maman, as he always
somewhat nauseously called Madame de Warens, extinguished the vile
thought and washed away its last traces.<a name="FNanchor73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73">[73]</a> After all, those
men and women are exceptionally happy, who have no such involuntary
meanness of thought standing against themselves in that unwritten
chapter of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.72" id="Page_i.72">[i.72]</a></span> lives which even the most candid persons keep
privately locked up in shamefast recollection.</p>
<p>Shortly after his return to Chamb&#233;ri, a wave from the
great tide of European affairs surged into the quiet valleys of
Savoy. In the February of 1733, Augustus the Strong died, and the
usual disorder followed in the choice of a successor to him in the
kingship of Poland. France was for Stanislaus, the father-in-law of
Lewis XV., while the Emperor Charles VI. and Anne of Russia were
for August III., elector of Saxony. Stanislaus was compelled to
flee, and the French Government, taking up his quarrel, declared
war against the Emperor (October 14, 1733). The first act of this
war, which was to end in the acquisition of Naples and the two
Sicilies by Spanish Bourbons, and of Lorraine by France, was the
despatch of a French expedition to the Milanese under Marshall
Villars, the husband of one of Voltaire's first idols. This took
place in the autumn of 1733, and a French column passed through
Chamb&#233;ri, exciting lively interest in all minds, including
Rousseau's. He now read the newspapers for the first time, with the
most eager sympathy for the country with whose history his own name
was destined to be so permanently associated. &quot;If this mad
passion,&quot; he says, &quot;had only been momentary, I should not speak of
it; but for no visible reason it took such root in my heart, that
when I afterwards at Paris played the stern republican, I could not
help feeling in spite of myself a secret predilection for the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.73" id="Page_i.73">[i.73]</a></span>
nation that I found so servile, and the government I made bold to
assail.&quot;<a name="FNanchor74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74">[74]</a>
This fondness for France was strong, constant, and invincible, and
found what was in the eighteenth century a natural complement in a
corresponding dislike of England.<a name="FNanchor75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75">[75]</a></p>
<p>Rousseau's health began to show signs of weakness. His breath
became asthmatic, he had palpitations, he spat blood, and suffered
from a slow feverishness from which he never afterwards became
entirely free.<a name="FNanchor76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76">[76]</a> His mind was as feverish as his body, and
the morbid broodings which active life reduces to their lowest
degree in most young men, were left to make full havoc along with
the seven devils of idleness and vacuity. An instinct which may
flow from the unrecognised animal lying deep down in us all,
suggested the way of return to wholesomeness. Rousseau prevailed
upon Madame de Warens to leave the stifling streets for the fresh
fields, and to deliver herself by retreat to rural solitude from
the adventurers who made her their prey. Les Charmettes, the modest
farm-house to which they retired, still stands. The modern
traveller, with a taste for relieving an imagination strained by
great historic monuments and secular landmarks, with the sight of
spots associated with the passion and meditation of some
far-shining teacher of men, may walk a short league from where the
gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.74" id="Page_i.74">[i.74]</a></span> slate roofs of dull Chamb&#233;ri bake in the sun, and
ascending a gently mounting road, with high leafy bank on the right
throwing cool shadows over his head, and a stream on the left
making music at his feet, he sees an old red housetop lifted lonely
above the trees. The homes in which men have lived now and again
lend themselves to the beholder's subjective impression; they
seemed to be brooding in forlorn isolation like some life-wearied
gray-beard over ancient and sorrow-stricken memories. At Les
Charmettes a pitiful melancholy penetrates you. The supreme
loveliness of the scene, the sweet-smelling meadows, the orchard,
the water-ways, the little vineyard with here and there a rose
glowing crimson among the yellow stunted vines, the rust-red crag
of the Nivolet rising against the sky far across the broad valley;
the contrast between all this peace, beauty, silence, and the
diseased miserable life of the famous man who found a scanty span
of paradise in the midst of it, touches the soul with a pathetic
spell. We are for the moment lifted out of squalor, vagrancy, and
disorder, and seem to hear some of the harmonies which sounded to
this perturbed spirit, soothing it, exalting it, and stirring those
inmost vibrations which in truth make up all the short divine part
of a man's life.<a name="FNanchor77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.75" id="Page_i.75">[i.75]</a></span></p>

<p>&quot;No day passes,&quot; he wrote in the very year in which he died, &quot;in
which I do not recall with joy and tender effusion this single and
brief time in my life, when I was fully myself, without mixture or
hindrance, and when I may say in a true sense that I lived. I may
almost say, like the prefect when disgraced and proceeding to end
his days tranquilly in the country, 'I have passed seventy years on
the earth, and I have lived but seven of them.' But for this brief
and precious space, I should perhaps have remained uncertain about
myself; for during all the rest of my life I have been so agitated,
tossed, plucked hither and thither by the passions of others, that,
being nearly passive in a life so stormy, I should find it hard to
distinguish what belonged to me in my own conduct,&#8212;to such a
degree has harsh necessity weighed upon me. But during these few
years I did what I wished to do, I was what I wished to be.&quot;<a name="FNanchor78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78">[78]</a> The secret of
such rare felicity is hardly to be described in words. It was the
ease of a profoundly sensuous nature with every sense gratified and
fascinated. Caressing and undivided affection within doors, all the
sweetness and movement of nature without, solitude, freedom, and
the busy idleness of life in gardens,&#8212;these were the conditions of
Rousseau's ideal state. &quot;If my happiness,&quot; he says, in language of
strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.76" id="Page_i.76">[i.76]</a></span> felicity, &quot;consisted in facts, actions, or words, I might
then describe and represent it in some way; but how say what was
neither said nor done nor even thought, but only enjoyed and felt
without my being able to point to any other object of my happiness
than the very feeling itself? I arose with the sun and I was happy;
I went out of doors and I was happy; I saw Maman and I was happy; I
left her and I was happy; I went among the woods and hills, I
wandered about in the dells, I read, I was idle, I dug in the
garden, I gathered fruit, I helped them indoors, and everywhere
happiness followed me. It was not in any given thing, it was all in
myself, and could never leave me for a single instant.&quot;<a name="FNanchor79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79">[79]</a> This was a true
garden of Eden, with the serpent in temporary quiescence, and we
may count the man rare since the fall who has found such happiness
in such conditions, and not less blessed than he is rare. The fact
that he was one of this chosen company was among the foremost of
the circumstances which made Rousseau seem to so many men in the
eighteenth century as a spring of water in a thirsty land.</p>
<p>All innocent and amiable things moved him. He used to spend
hours together in taming pigeons; he inspired them with such
confidence that they would follow him about, and allow him to take
them wherever he would, and the moment that he appeared in the
garden two or three of them would instantly settle on his arms or
his head. The bees, too, gradually came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.77" id="Page_i.77">[i.77]</a></span> put the same trust in
him, and his whole life was surrounded with gentle companionship.
He always began the day with the sun, walking on the high ridge
above the slope on which the house lay, and going through his form
of worship. &quot;It did not consist in a vain moving of the lips, but
in a sincere elevation of heart to the author of the tender nature
whose beauties lay spread out before my eyes. This act passed
rather in wonder and contemplation than in requests; and I always
knew that with the dispenser of true blessings, the best means of
obtaining those which are needful for us, is less to ask than to
deserve them.&quot;<a name="FNanchor80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80">[80]</a> These effusions may be taken for the
beginning of the deistical reaction in the eighteenth century.
While the truly scientific and progressive spirits were occupied in
laborious preparation for adding to human knowledge and
systematising it, Rousseau walked with his head in the clouds among
gods, beneficent authors of nature, wise dispensers of blessings,
and the like. &quot;Ah, madam,&quot; he once said, &quot;sometimes in the privacy
of my study, with my hands pressed tight over my eyes or in the
darkness of the night, I am of his opinion that there is no God.
But look yonder (pointing with his hand to the sky, with head
erect, and an inspired glance): the rising of the sun, as it
scatters the mists that cover the earth and lays bare the wondrous
glittering scene of nature, disperses at the same moment all cloud
from my soul. I find my faith again, and my God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.78" id="Page_i.78">[i.78]</a></span> my belief in
him. I admire and adore him, and I prostrate myself in his
presence.&quot;<a name="FNanchor81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81">[81]</a>
As if that settled the question affirmatively, any more than the
absence of such theistic emotion in many noble spirits settles it
negatively. God became the highest known formula for sensuous
expansion, the synthesis of all complacent emotions, and Rousseau
filled up the measure of his delight by creating and invoking a
Supreme Being to match with fine scenery and sunny gardens. We
shall have a better occasion to mark the attributes of this
important conception when we come to <i>Emilius</i>, where it was
launched in a panoply of resounding phrases upon a Europe which was
grown too strong for Christian dogma, and was not yet grown strong
enough to rest in a provisional ordering of the results of its own
positive knowledge. Walking on the terrace at Les Charmettes, you
are at the very birth-place of that particular &#202;tre
Supr&#234;me to whom Robespierre offered the incense of an
official festival.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reading of a Jansenist book would make him unhappy
by the prominence into which it brought the displeasing idea of
hell, and he used now and then to pass a miserable day in wondering
whether this cruel destiny should be his. Madame de Warens, whose
softness of heart inspired her with a theology that ought to have
satisfied a seraphic doctor, had abolished hell, but she could not
dispense with purgatory because she did not know what to do with
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.79" id="Page_i.79">[i.79]</a></span> souls of the wicked, being unable either to damn them, or to
instal them among the good until they had been purified into
goodness. In truth it must be confessed, says Rousseau, that alike
in this world and the other the wicked are extremely
embarrassing.<a name="FNanchor82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82">[82]</a> His own search after knowledge of his fate
is well known. One day, amusing himself in a characteristic manner
by throwing stones at trees, he began to be tormented by fear of
the eternal pit. He resolved to test his doom by throwing a stone
at a particular tree; if he hit, then salvation; if he missed, then
perdition. With a trembling hand and beating heart he threw; as he
had chosen a large tree and was careful not to place himself too
far away, all was well.<a name="FNanchor83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83">[83]</a> As a rule, however, in spite of the ugly
phantoms of theology, he passed his days in a state of calm. Even
when illness brought it into his head that he should soon know the
future lot by more assured experiment, he still preserved a
tranquillity which he justly qualifies as sensual.</p>
<p>In thinking of Rousseau's peculiar feeling for nature, which
acquired such a decisive place in his character during his life at
Les Charmettes, it is to be remembered that it was entirely devoid
of that stormy and boisterous quality which has grown up in more
modern literature, out of the violent attempt to press nature in
her most awful moods into the service of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.80" id="Page_i.80">[i.80]</a></span> revolt against a
social and religious tradition that can no longer be endured. Of
this revolt Rousseau was a chief, and his passion for natural
aspects was connected with this attitude, but he did not seize
those of them which the poet of <i>Manfred</i>, for example, forced
into an imputed sympathy with his own rebellion. Rousseau always
loved nature best in her moods of quiescence and serenity, and in
proportion as she lent herself to such moods in men. He liked
rivulets better than rivers. He could not bear the sight of the
sea; its infertile bosom and blind restless tumblings filled him
with melancholy. The ruins of a park affected him more than the
ruins of castles.<a name="FNanchor84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84">[84]</a> It is true that no plain, however
beautiful, ever seemed so in his eyes; he required torrents, rocks,
dark forests, mountains, and precipices.<a name="FNanchor85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85">[85]</a> This does not
affect the fact that he never moralised appalling landscape, as
post-revolutionary writers have done, and that the Alpine wastes
which throw your puniest modern into a rapture, had no attraction
for him. He could steep himself in nature without climbing fifteen
thousand feet to find her. In landscape, as has been said by one
with a right to speak, Rousseau was truly a great artist, and you
can, if you are artistic too, follow him with confidence in his
wanderings; he understood that beauty does not require a great
stage, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.81" id="Page_i.81">[i.81]</a></span> effect of things lies in harmony.<a name="FNanchor86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86">[86]</a> The humble
heights of the Jura, and the lovely points of the valley of
Chamb&#233;ri, sufficed to give him all the pleasure of which he
was capable. In truth a man cannot escape from his time, and
Rousseau at least belonged to the eighteenth century in being
devoid of the capacity for feeling awe, and the taste for objects
inspiring it. Nature was a tender friend with softest bosom, and no
sphinx with cruel enigma. He felt neither terror, nor any sense of
the littleness of man, nor of the mysteriousness of life, nor of
the unseen forces which make us their sport, as he peered over the
precipice and heard the water roaring at the bottom of it; he only
remained for hours enjoying the physical sensation of dizziness
with which it turned his brain, with a break now and again for
hurling large stones, and watching them roll and leap down into the
torrent, with as little reflection and as little articulate emotion
as if he had been a child.<a name="FNanchor87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87">[87]</a></p>
<p>Just as it is convenient for purposes of classification to
divide a man into body and soul, even when we believe the soul to
be only a function of the body, so people talk of his intellectual
side and his emotional side, his thinking quality and his feeling
quality, though in fact and at the roots these qualities are not
two but one, with temperament for the common substratum. During
this period of his life the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.82" id="Page_i.82">[i.82]</a></span> Rousseau's true force went
into his feelings, and at all times feeling predominated over
reflection, with many drawbacks and some advantages of a very
critical kind for subsequent generations of men. Nearly every one
who came into contact with him in the way of testing his capacity
for being instructed pronounced him hopeless. He had several
excellent opportunities of learning Latin, especially at Turin in
the house of Count Gouvon, and in the seminary at Annecy, and at
Les Charmettes he did his best to teach himself, but without any
better result than a very limited power of reading. In learning one
rule he forgot the last; he could never master the most elementary
laws of versification; he learnt and re-learnt twenty times the
Eclogues of Virgil, but not a single word remained with him.<a name="FNanchor88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88">[88]</a> He was absolutely
without verbal memory, and he pronounces himself wholly incapable
of learning anything from masters. Madame de Warens tried to have
him taught both dancing and fencing; he could never achieve a
minuet, and after three months of instruction he was as clumsy and
helpless with his foil as he had been on the first day. He resolved
to become a master at the chessboard; he shut himself up in his
room, and worked night and day over the books with indescribable
efforts which covered many weeks. On proceeding to the caf&#233;
to manifest his powers, he found that all the moves and
combinations had got mixed up in his head, he saw nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.83" id="Page_i.83">[i.83]</a></span>
clouds on the board, and as often as he repeated the experiment he
only found himself weaker than before. Even in music, for which he
had a genuine passion and at which he worked hard, he never could
acquire any facility at sight, and he was an inaccurate scorer,
even when only copying the score of others.<a name="FNanchor89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89">[89]</a></p>
<p>Two things nearly incompatible, he writes in an important
passage, are united in me without my being able to think how; an
extremely ardent temperament, lively and impetuous passions, along
with ideas that are very slow in coming to birth, very embarrassed,
and which never arise until after the event. &quot;One would say that my
heart and my intelligence do not belong to the same individual....
I feel all, and see nothing; I am carried away, but I am stupid....
This slowness of thinking, united with such vivacity of feeling,
possesses me not only in conversation, but when I am alone and
working. My ideas arrange themselves in my head with incredible
difficulty; they circulate there in a dull way and ferment until
they agitate me, fill me with heat, and give me palpitations; in
the midst of this stir I see nothing clearly, I could not write a
single word. Insensibly the violent emotion grows still, the chaos
is disentangled, everything falls into its place, but very slowly
and after long and confused agitation.&quot;<a name="FNanchor90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90">[90]</a></p>
<p>So far from saying that his heart and intelligence belonged to
two persons, we might have been quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.84" id="Page_i.84">[i.84]</a></span> sure, knowing his heart, that
his intelligence must be exactly what he describes its process to
have been. The slow-burning ecstasy in which he knew himself at his
height and was most conscious of fulness of life, was incompatible
with the rapid and deliberate generation of ideas. The same soft
passivity, the same receptiveness, which made his emotions like the
surface of a lake under sky and breeze, entered also into the
working of his intellectual faculties. But it happens that in this
region, in the attainment of knowledge, truth, and definite
thoughts, even receptiveness implies a distinct and active energy,
and hence the very quality of temperament which left him free and
eager for sensuous impressions, seemed to muffle his intelligence
in a certain opaque and resisting medium, of the indefinable kind
that interposes between will and action in a dream. His rational
part was fatally protected by a non-conducting envelope of
sentiment; this intercepted clear ideas on their passage, and even
cut off the direct and true impress of those objects and their
relations, which are the material of clear ideas. He was no doubt
right in his avowal that objects generally made less impression on
him than the recollection of them; that he could see nothing of
what was before his eyes, and had only his intelligence in cases
where memories were concerned; and that of what was said or done in
his presence, he felt and penetrated nothing.<a name="FNanchor91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91">[91]</a> In other words,
this is to say that his material of thought was not fact but image.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.85" id="Page_i.85">[i.85]</a></span>
When he plunged into reflection, he did not deal with the objects
of reflection at first hand and in themselves, but only with the
reminiscences of objects, which he had never approached in a spirit
of deliberate and systematic observation, and with those
reminiscences, moreover, suffused and saturated by the impalpable
but most potent essences of a fermenting imagination. Instead of
urgently seeking truth with the patient energy, the wariness, and
the conscience, with the sharpened instruments, the systematic
apparatus, and the minute feelers and tentacles of the genuine
thinker and solid reasoner, he only floated languidly on a summer
tide of sensation, and captured premiss and conclusion in a
succession of swoons. It would be a mistake to contend that no work
can be done for the world by this method, or that truth only comes
to those who chase her with logical forceps. But one should always
try to discover how a teacher of men came by his ideas, whether by
careful toil, or by the easy bequest of generous phantasy.</p>
<p>To give a zest to rural delight, and partly perhaps to satisfy
the intellectual interest which must have been an instinct in one
who became so consummate a master in the great and noble art of
composition, Rousseau, during the time when he lived with Madame de
Warens, tried as well as he knew how to acquire a little knowledge
of what fruit the cultivation of the mind of man had hitherto
brought forth. According to his own account, it was Voltaire's
Letters on the English which first drew him seriously to study, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.86" id="Page_i.86">[i.86]</a></span>
nothing which that illustrious man wrote at this time escaped him.
His taste for Voltaire inspired him with the desire of writing with
elegance, and of imitating &quot;the fine and enchanting colour of
Voltaire's style&quot;<a name="FNanchor92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92">[92]</a>&#8212;an object in which he cannot be held to
have in the least succeeded, though he achieved a superb style of
his own. On his return from Turin Madame de Warens had begun in
some small way to cultivate a taste for letters in him, though he
had lost the enthusiasm of his childhood for reading. Saint
Evremond, Puffendorff, the Henriade, and the Spectator happened to
be in his room, and he turned over their pages. The Spectator, he
says, pleased him greatly and did him much good.<a name="FNanchor93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93">[93]</a> Madame de Warens
was what he calls protestant in literary taste, and would talk for
ever of the great Bayle, while she thought more of Saint Evremond
than she could ever persuade Rousseau to think. Two or three years
later than this he began to use his own mind more freely, and
opened his eyes for the first time to the greatest question that
ever dawns upon any human intelligence that has the privilege of
discerning it, the problem of a philosophy and a body of
doctrine.</p>
<p>His way of answering it did not promise the best results. He
read an introduction to the Sciences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.87" id="Page_i.87">[i.87]</a></span> then he took an
Encyclop&#230;dia and tried to learn all things together, until he
repented and resolved to study subjects apart. This he found a
better plan for one to whom long application was so fatiguing, that
he could not with any effect occupy himself for half an hour on any
one matter, especially if following the ideas of another
person.<a name="FNanchor94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94">[94]</a> He
began his morning's work, after an hour or two of dispersive chat,
with the Port-Royal Logic, Locke's Essay on the Human
Understanding, Malebranche, Leibnitz, Descartes.<a name="FNanchor95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95">[95]</a> He found these
authors in a condition of such perpetual contradiction among
themselves, that he formed the chimerical design of reconciling
them with one another. This was tedious, so he took up another
method, on which he congratulated himself to the end of his life.
It consisted in simply adopting and following the ideas of each
author, without comparing them either with one another or with
those of other writers, and above all without any criticism of his
own. Let me begin, he said, by collecting a store of ideas, true or
false, but at any rate clear, until my head is well enough stocked
to enable me to compare and choose. At the end of some years passed
&quot;in never thinking exactly, except after other people, without
reflecting so to speak, and almost without reasoning,&quot; he found
himself in a state to think for himself. &quot;In spite of beginning
late to exercise my judicial faculty, I never found that it had
lost its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.88" id="Page_i.88">[i.88]</a></span> vigour, and when I came to publish my own ideas, I was
hardly accused of being a servile disciple.&quot;<a name="FNanchor96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96">[96]</a></p>
<p>To that fairly credible account of the matter, one can only say
that this mutually exclusive way of learning the thoughts of
others, and developing thoughts of your own, is for an adult
probably the most mischievous, where it is not the most impotent,
fashion in which intellectual exercise can well be taken. It is
exactly the use of the judicial faculty, criticising, comparing,
and defining, which is indispensable in order that a student should
not only effectually assimilate the ideas of a writer, but even
know what those ideas come to and how much they are worth. And so
when he works at ideas of his own, a judicial faculty which has
been kept studiously slumbering for some years, is not likely to
revive in full strength without any preliminary training. Rousseau
was a man of singular genius, and he set an extraordinary mark on
Europe, but this mark would have been very different if he had ever
mastered any one system of thought, or if he had ever fully grasped
what systematic thinking means. Instead of this, his debt to the
men whom he read was a debt of piecemeal, and his obligation an
obligation for fragments; and this is perhaps the worst way of
acquiring an intellectual lineage, for it leaves out the vital
continuity of temper and method. It is a small thing to accept this
or that of Locke's notions upon education or the origin of ideas,
if you do not see the merit of his way of coming by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.89" id="Page_i.89">[i.89]</a></span> notions. In
short, Rousseau has distinctions in abundance, but the distinction
of knowing how to think, in the exact sense of that term, was
hardly among them, and neither now nor at any other time did he go
through any of that toilsome and vigorous intellectual preparation
to which the ablest of his contemporaries, Diderot, Voltaire,
D'Alembert, Turgot, Condorcet, Hume, all submitted themselves. His
comfortable view was that &quot;the sensible and interesting
conversations of a woman of merit are more proper to form a young
man than all the pedantical philosophy of books.&quot;<a name="FNanchor97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97">[97]</a></p>
<p>Style, however, in which he ultimately became such a proficient,
and which wrought such marvels as only style backed by passion can
work, already engaged his serious attention. We have already seen
how Voltaire implanted in him the first root idea, which so many of
us never perceive at all, that there is such a quality of writing
as style. He evidently took pains with the form of expression and
thought about it, in obedience to some inborn harmonious
predisposition which is the source of all veritable eloquence,
though there is no strong trace now nor for many years to come of
any irresistible inclination for literary composition. We find him,
indeed, in 1736 showing consciousness of a slight skill in
writing,<a name="FNanchor98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98">[98]</a>
but he only thought of it as a possible recommendation for a
secretaryship to some great person. He also appears to have
practised verses, not for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.90" id="Page_i.90">[i.90]</a></span> own sake, for he always most justly
thought his own verses mediocre, and they are even worse; but on
the ground that verse-making is a rather good exercise for breaking
one's self to elegant inversions, and learning a greater ease in
prose.<a name="FNanchor99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99">[99]</a> At
the age of one and twenty he composed a comedy, long afterwards
damned as <i>Narcisse</i>. Such prelusions, however, were of small
importance compared with the fact of his being surrounded by a
moral atmosphere in which his whole mind was steeped. It is not in
the study of Voltaire or another, but in the deep soft soil of
constant mood and old habit that such a style as Rousseau's has its
growth.</p>
<p>It was the custom to return to Chamb&#233;ri for the winter,
and the day of their departure from Les Charmettes was always a day
blurred and tearful for Rousseau; he never left it without kissing
the ground, the trees, the flowers; he had to be torn away from it
as from a loved companion. At the first melting of the winter snows
they left their dungeon in Chamb&#233;ri, and they never missed
the earliest song of the nightingale. Many a joyful day of summer
peace remained vivid in Rousseau's memory, and made a mixed heaven
and hell for him long years after in the stifling dingy Paris
street, and the raw and cheerless air of a Derbyshire
winter.<a name="FNanchor100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100">[100]</a>
&quot;We started early in the morning,&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.91" id="Page_i.91">[i.91]</a></span> he says, describing one of these
simple excursions on the day of St. Lewis, who was the very
unconscious patron saint of Madame de Warens, &quot;together and alone;
I proposed that we should go and ramble about the side of the
valley opposite to our own, which we had not yet visited. We sent
our provisions on before us, for we were to be out all day. We went
from hill to hill and wood to wood, sometimes in the sun and often
in the shade, resting from time to time and forgetting ourselves
for whole hours; chatting about ourselves, our union, our dear lot,
and offering unheard prayers that it might last. All seemed to
conspire for the bliss of this day. Rain had fallen a short time
before; there was no dust, and the little streams were full; a
light fresh breeze stirred the leaves, the air was pure, the
horizon without a cloud, and the same serenity reigned in our own
hearts. Our dinner was cooked in a peasant's cottage, and we shared
it with his family. These Savoyards are such good souls! After
dinner we sought shade under some tall trees, where, while I
collected dry sticks for making our coffee, Maman amused herself by
botanising among the bushes, and the expedition ended in transports
of tenderness and effusion.&quot;<a name="FNanchor101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101">[101]</a> This is one of such days as the soul
turns back to when the misery that stalks after us all has seized
it, and a man is left to the sting and smart of the memory of
irrecoverable things.</p>
<p>He was resolved to bind himself to Madame de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.92" id="Page_i.92">[i.92]</a></span> Warens with an
inalterable fidelity for all the rest of his days; he would watch
over her with all the dutiful and tender vigilance of a son, and
she should be to him something dearer than mother or wife or
sister. What actually befell was this. He was attacked by vapours,
which he characterises as the disorder of the happy. One symptom of
his disease was the conviction derived from the rash perusal of
surgeon's treatises, that he was suffering from a polypus in the
heart. On the not very chivalrous principle that if he did not
spend Madame de Warens' money, he was only leaving it for
adventurers and knaves, he proceeded to Montpellier to consult the
physicians, and took the money for his expenses out of his
benefactress's store, which was always slender because it was
always open to any hand. While on the road, he fell into an
intrigue with a travelling companion, whom critics have compared to
the fair Philina of Wilhelm Meister. In due time, the Montpellier
doctor being unable to discover a disease, declared that the
patient had none. The scenery was dull and unattractive, and this
would have counterbalanced the weightiest prudential reasons with
him at any time. Rousseau debated whether he should keep tryst with
his gay fellow-traveller, or return to Chamb&#233;ri. Remorse and
that intractable emptiness of pocket which is the iron key to many
a deed of ingenuous-looking self-denial and Spartan virtue,
directed him homewards. Here he had a surprise, and perhaps learnt
a lesson. He found installed in the house a personage whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.93" id="Page_i.93">[i.93]</a></span> he
describes as tall, fair, noisy, coxcombical, flat-faced,
flat-souled. Another triple alliance seemed a thing odious in the
eyes of a man whom his travelling diversions had made a Pharisee
for the hour. He protested, but Madame de Warens was a woman of
principle, and declined to let Rousseau, who had profited by the
doctrine of indifference, now set up in his own favour the contrary
doctrine of a narrow and churlish partiality. So a short,
delicious, and never-forgotten episode came to an end: this pair
who had known so much happiness together were happy together no
more, and the air became peopled for Rousseau with wan spectres of
dead joys and fast gathering cares.</p>
<p>The dates of the various events described in the fifth and sixth
books of the Confessions are inextricable, and the order is
evidently inverted more than once. The inversion of order is less
serious than the contradictions between the dates of the
Confessions and the more authentic and unmistakable dates of his
letters. For instance, he describes a visit to Geneva as having
been made shortly before Lautrec's temporary pacification of the
civic troubles of that town; and that event took place in the
spring of 1738. This would throw the Montpellier journey, which he
says came after the visit to Geneva, into 1738, but the letters to
Madame de Warens from Grenoble and Montpellier are dated in the
autumn and winter of 1737.<a name="FNanchor102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102">[102]</a> Minor verifications attest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.94" id="Page_i.94">[i.94]</a></span>
exactitude of the dates of the letters,<a name="FNanchor103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103">[103]</a> and we may
therefore conclude that he returned from Montpellier, found his
place taken and lost his old delight in Les Charmettes, in the
early part of 1738. In the tenth of the R&#234;veries he speaks of
having passed &quot;a space of four or five years&quot; in the bliss of Les
Charmettes, and it is true that his connection with it in one way
and another lasted from the middle of 1736 until about the middle
of 1741. But as he left for Montpellier in the autumn of 1737, and
found the obnoxious Vinzenried installed in 1738, the pure and
characteristic felicity of Les Charmettes perhaps only lasted about
a year or a year and a half. But a year may set a deep mark on a
man, and give him imperishable taste of many things bitter and
sweet.</p>

had once belonged to his namesake, Jean Baptiste Rousseau (<i>b.

counting the first of French lyric poets. There was a third
Rousseau, Pierre [<i>b. 1725&#8212;d. 1785</i>], who wrote plays and did
other work now well forgotten. There are some lines imperfectly
commemorative of the trio&#8212;</p>

Rousseau gives 1732 as the probable date of his return to
Chamb&#233;ri, after his first visit to Paris [<i>Conf.</i>, v.
305], and the only objection to this is his mention of the incident
of the march of the French troops, which could not have happened
until the winter of 1733, as having taken place &quot;some months&quot; after
his arrival. Musset-Pathay accepts this as decisive, and fixes the
return in the spring of 1733 [i. 12]. My own conjectural chronology
is this: Returns from Turin towards the autumn of 1729; stays at
Annecy until the spring of 1731; passes the winter of 1731-2 at
Neuch&#226;tel; first visits Paris in spring of 1732; returns to
Savoy in the early summer of 1732. But a precise harmonising of the
dates in the Confessions is impossible; Rousseau wrote them three
and thirty years after our present point [in 1766 at Wootton], and
never claimed to be exact in minuteness of date. Fortunately such
matters in the present case are absolutely devoid of
importance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV."></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THERESA LE VASSEUR.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Men</span> like Rousseau, who are most heedless in letting their
delight perish, are as often as not most loth to bury what they
have slain, or even to perceive that life has gone out of it. The
sight of simple hearts trying to coax back a little warm breath of
former days into a present that is stiff and cold with
indifference, is touching enough. But there is a certain grossness
around the circumstances in which Rousseau now and too often found
himself, that makes us watch his embarrassment with some composure.
One cannot easily think of him as a simple heart, and we feel
perhaps as much relief as he, when he resolves after making all due
efforts to thrust out the intruder and bring Madame de Warens over
from theories which had become too practical to be interesting, to
leave Les Charmettes and accept a tutorship at Lyons. His new
patron was a De Mably, elder brother of the philosophic abb&#233;
of the same name (1709-85), and of the still more notable Condillac
(1714-80).</p>
<p>The future author of the most influential treatise on education
that has ever been written, was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.96" id="Page_i.96">[i.96]</a></span>
 successful in the practical and
far more arduous side of that master art.<a name="FNanchor104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104">[104]</a> We have seen
how little training he had ever given himself in the cardinal
virtues of collectedness and self-control, and we know this to be
the indispensable quality in all who have to shape young minds for
a humane life. So long as all went well, he was an angel, but when
things went wrong, he is willing to confess that he was a devil.
When his two pupils could not understand him, he became frantic;
when they showed wilfulness or any other part of the disagreeable
materials out of which, along with the rest, human excellence has
to be ingeniously and painfully manufactured, he was ready to kill
them. This, as he justly admits, was not the way to render them
either well learned or sage. The moral education of the teacher
himself was hardly complete, for he describes how he used to steal
his employer's wine, and the exquisite draughts which he enjoyed in
the secrecy of his own room, with a piece of cake in one hand and
some dear romance in the other. We should forgive greedy pilferings
of this kind more easily if Rousseau had forgotten them more
speedily. These are surely offences for which the best expiation is
oblivion in a throng of worthier memories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.97" id="Page_i.97">[i.97]</a></span></p>

<p>It is easy to understand how often Rousseau's mind turned from
the deadly drudgery of his present employment to the beatitude of
former days. &quot;What rendered my present condition insupportable was
the recollection of my beloved Charmettes, of my garden, my trees,
my fountain, my orchard, and above all of her for whom I felt
myself born and who gave life to it all. As I thought of her, of
our pleasures, our guileless days, I was seized by a tightness in
my heart, a stopping of my breath, which robbed me of all
spirit.&quot;<a name="FNanchor105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105">[105]</a>
For years to come this was a kind of far-off accompaniment,
thrumming melodiously in his ears under all the discords of a
miserable life. He made another effort to quicken the dead.
Throwing up his office with his usual promptitude in escaping from
the irksome, after a residence of something like a year at Lyons
(April, 1740&#8212;spring of 1741), he made his way back to his old
haunts. The first half-hour with Madame de Warens persuaded him
that happiness here was really at an end. After a stay of a few
months, his desolation again overcame him. It was agreed that he
should go to Paris to make his fortune by a new method of musical
notation which he had invented, and after a short stay at Lyons, he
found himself for the second time in the famous city which in the
eighteenth century had become for the moment the centre of the
universe.<a name="FNanchor106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106">[106]</a></p>
<p>It was not yet, however, destined to be a centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.98" id="Page_i.98">[i.98]</a></span>
 for him. His
plan of musical notation was examined by a learned committee of the
Academy, no member of whom was instructed in the musical art.
Rousseau, dumb, inarticulate, and unready as usual, was amazed at
the ease with which his critics by the free use of sounding phrases
demolished arguments and objections which he perceived that they
did not at all understand. His experience on this occasion
suggested to him the most just reflection, how even without breadth
of intelligence, the profound knowledge of any one thing is
preferable in forming a judgment about it, to all possible
enlightenment conferred by the cultivation of the sciences, without
study of the special matter in question. It astonished him that all
these learned men, who knew so many things, could yet be so
ignorant that a man should only pretend to be a judge in his own
craft.<a name="FNanchor107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107">[107]</a></p>
<p>His musical path to glory and riches thus blocked up, he
surrendered himself not to despair but to complete idleness and
peace of mind. He had a few coins left, and these prevented him
from thinking of a future. He was presented to one or two great
ladies, and with the blundering gallantry habitual to him he wrote
a letter to one of the greatest of them, declaring his passion for
her. Madame Dupin was the daughter of one, and the wife of another,
of the richest men in France, and the attentions of a man whose
acquaintance Madame Beuzenval had begun by inviting him to dine in
the servants' hall, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.99" id="Page_i.99">[i.99]</a></span>
 not pleasing to her.<a name="FNanchor108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108">[108]</a> She forgave
the impertinence eventually, and her stepson, M. Francueil, was
Rousseau's patron for some years.<a name="FNanchor109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109">[109]</a> On the whole, however, in spite of his
own account of his social ineptitude, there cannot have been
anything so repulsive in his manners as this account would lead us
to think. There is no grave anachronism in introducing here the
impression which he made on two fine ladies not many years after
this. &quot;He pays compliments, yet he is not polite, or at least he is
without the air of politeness. He seems to be ignorant of the
usages of society, but it is easily seen that he is infinitely
intelligent. He has a brown complexion, while eyes that overflow
with fire give animation to his expression. When he has spoken and
you look at him, he appears comely; but when you try to recall him,
his image is always extremely plain. They say that he has bad
health, and endures agony which from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.100" id="Page_i.100">[i.100]</a></span>
 some motive of vanity he most
carefully conceals. It is this, I fancy, which gives him from time
to time an air of sullenness.&quot;<a name="FNanchor110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110">[110]</a> The other lady, who saw him at the same
time, speaks of &quot;the poor devil of an author, who's as poor as Job
for you, but with wit and vanity enough for four.... They say his
history is as queer as his person, and that is saying a good
deal.... Madame Maupeou and I tried to guess what it was. 'In spite
of his face,' said she (for it is certain he is uncommonly plain),
'his eyes tell that love plays a great part in his romance.' 'No,'
said I, 'his nose tells me that it is vanity.' 'Well then, 'tis
both one and the other.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111">[111]</a></p>
<p>One of his patronesses took some trouble to procure him the post
of secretary to the French ambassador at Venice, and in the spring
of 1743 our much-wandering man started once more in quest of meat
and raiment in the famous city of the Adriatic. This was one of
those steps of which there are not a few in a man's life, that seem
at the moment to rank foremost in the short line of decisive acts,
and then are presently seen not to have been decisive at all, but
mere interruptions conducting nowhither. In truth the critical
moments with us are mostly as points in slumber. Even if the
ancient oracles of the gods were to regain their speech once more
on the earth, men would usually go to consult them on days when the
answer would have least significance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.101" id="Page_i.101">[i.101]</a></span>
 and could guide them least
far. That one of the most heedless vagrants in Europe, and as it
happened one of the men of most extraordinary genius also, should
have got a footing in the train of the ambassador of a great
government, would naturally seem to him and others as chance's one
critical stroke in his life. In reality it was nothing. The Count
of Montaigu, his master, was one of the worst characters with whom
Rousseau could for his own profit have been brought into contact.
In his professional quality he was not far from imbecile. The folly
and weakness of the government at Versailles during the reign of
Lewis XV., and its indifference to competence in every department
except perhaps partially in the fisc, was fairly illustrated in its
absurd representative at Venice. The secretary, whose renown has
preserved his master's name, has recorded more amply than enough
the grounds of quarrel between them. Rousseau is for once eager to
assert his own efficiency, and declares that he rendered many
important services for which he was repaid with ingratitude and
persecution.<a name="FNanchor112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112">[112]</a> One would be glad to know what the Count
of Montaigu's version of matters was, for in truth Rousseau's
conduct in previous posts makes us wonder how it was that he who
had hitherto always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.102" id="Page_i.102">[i.102]</a></span> been unfaithful over few things, suddenly
touched perfection when he became lord over many.</p>
<p>There is other testimony, however, to the ambassador's morbid
quality, of which, after that general imbecility which was too
common a thing among men in office to be remarkable, avarice was
the most striking trait. For instance, careful observation had
persuaded him that three shoes are equivalent to two pairs, because
there is always one of a pair which is more worn than its fellow;
and hence he habitually ordered his shoes in threes.<a name="FNanchor113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113">[113]</a> It was natural
enough that such a master and such a secretary should quarrel over
perquisites. That slightly cringing quality which we have noticed
on one or two occasions in Rousseau's hungry youthful time, had
been hardened out of him by circumstance or the strengthening of
inborn fibre. He would now neither dine in a servants' hall because
a fine lady forgot what was due to a musician, nor share his fees
with a great ambassador who forgot what was due to himself. These
sordid disputes are of no interest now to anybody, and we need only
say that after a period of eighteen months passed in uncongenial
company, Rousseau parted from his count in extreme dudgeon, and the
diplomatic career which he had promised to himself came to the same
close as various other careers had already done.</p>
<p>He returned to Paris towards the end of 1744, burning with
indignation at the unjust treatment which he believed himself to
have suffered, and laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.103" id="Page_i.103">[i.103]</a></span> memorial after memorial before the
minister at home. He assures us that it was the justice and the
futility of his complaints, that left in his soul the germ of
exasperation against preposterous civil institutions, &quot;in which the
true common weal and real justice are always sacrificed to some
seeming order or other, which is in fact destructive of all order,
and only adds the sanction of public authority to the oppression of
the weak and the iniquity of the strong.&quot;<a name="FNanchor114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114">[114]</a></p>
<p>One or two pictures connected with the Venetian episode remain
in the memory of the reader of the Confessions, and among them
perhaps with most people is that of the quarantine at Genoa in
Rousseau's voyage to his new post. The travellers had the choice of
remaining on board the felucca, or passing the time in an
unfurnished lazaretto. This, we may notice in passing, was his
first view of the sea; he makes no mention of the fact, nor does
the sight or thought of the sea appear to have left the least mark
in any line of his writings. He always disliked it, and thought of
it with melancholy. Rousseau, as we may suppose, found the want of
space and air in the boat the most intolerable of evils, and
preferred to go alone to the lazaretto, though it had neither
window-sashes nor tables nor chairs nor bed, nor even a truss of
straw to lie down upon. He was locked up and had the whole barrack
to himself. &quot;I manufactured,&quot; he says, &quot;a good bed out of my coats
and shirts, sheets out of towels which I stitched together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.104" id="Page_i.104">[i.104]</a></span> a
pillow out of my old cloak rolled up. I made myself a seat of one
trunk placed flat, and a table of the other. I got out some paper
and my writing-desk, and arranged some dozen books that I had by
way of library. In short I made myself so comfortable, that, with
the exception of curtains and windows, I was nearly as well off in
this absolutely naked lazaretto as in my lodgings in Paris. My
meals were served with much pomp; two grenadiers, with bayonets at
their musket-ends, escorted them; the staircase was my dining-room,
the landing did for table and the lower step for a seat, and when
my dinner was served, they rang a little bell as they withdrew, to
warn me to seat myself at table. Between my meals, when I was
neither writing nor reading, nor busy with my furnishing, I went
for a walk in the Protestant graveyard, or mounted into a lantern
which looked out on to the port, and whence I could see the ships
sailing in and out. I passed a fortnight in this way, and I could
have spent the whole three weeks of the quarantine without feeling
an instant's weariness.&quot;<a name="FNanchor115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115">[115]</a></p>
<p>These are the occasions when we catch glimpses of the true
Rousseau; but his residence in Venice was on the whole one of his
few really sociable periods. He made friends and kept them, and
there was even a certain gaiety in his life. He used to tell people
their fortunes in a way that an earlier century would have counted
unholy.<a name="FNanchor116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116">[116]</a>
He rarely sought pleasure in those of her haunts for which the
Queen of the Adri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.105" id="Page_i.105">[i.105]</a></span>atic had a guilty renown, but he has left one
singular anecdote, showing the degree to which profound sensibility
is capable of doing the moralist's work in a man, and how a stroke
of sympathetic imagination may keep one from sin more effectually
than an ethical precept.<a name="FNanchor117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117">[117]</a> It is pleasanter to think of him as
working at the formation of that musical taste which ten years
afterwards led him to amaze the Parisians by proving that French
melody was a hollow idea born of national self-delusion. A Venetian
experiment, whose evidence in the special controversy is less
weighty perhaps than Rousseau supposed, was among the facts which
persuaded him that Italian is the language of music. An Armenian
who had never heard any music was invited to listen first of all to
a French monologue, and then to an air of Galuppi's. Rousseau
observed in the Armenian more surprise than pleasure during the
performance of the French piece. The first notes of the Italian
were no sooner struck, than his eyes and whole expression softened;
he was enchanted, surrendered his whole soul to the ravishing
impressions of the music, and could never again be induced to
listen to the performance of any French air.<a name="FNanchor118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118">[118]</a></p>
<p>More important than this was the circumstance that the sight of
the defects of the government of the Venetian Republic first drew
his mind to political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.106" id="Page_i.106">[i.106]</a></span> speculation, and suggested to him the
composition of a book that was to be called Institutions
Politiques.<a name="FNanchor119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119">[119]</a> The work, as thus designed and named,
was never written, but the idea of it, after many years of
meditation, ripened first in the Discourse on Inequality, and then
in the Social Contract.</p>
<p>If Rousseau's departure for Venice was a wholly insignificant
element in his life, his return from it was almost immediately
followed by an event which counted for nothing at the moment, which
his friends by and by came to regard as the fatal and irretrievable
disaster of his life, but which he persistently described as the
only real consolation that heaven permitted him to taste in his
misery, and the only one that enabled him to bear his many sore
burdens.<a name="FNanchor120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120">[120]</a></p>
<p>He took up his quarters at a small and dirty hotel not far from
the Sorbonne, where he had alighted on the occasion of his second
arrival in Paris.<a name="FNanchor121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121">[121]</a> Here was a kitchen-maid, some
two-and-twenty years old, who used to sit at table with her
mistress and the guests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.107" id="Page_i.107">[i.107]</a></span> of the house. The company was rough, being
mainly composed of Irish and Gascon abb&#233;s, and other people
to whom graces of mien and refinement of speech had come neither by
nature nor cultivation. The hostess herself pitched the
conversation in merry Rabelaisian key, and the apparent modesty of
her serving-woman gave a zest to her own licence. Rousseau was
moved with pity for a maid defenceless against a ribald storm, and
from pity he advanced to some warmer sentiment, and he and Theresa
Le Vasseur took each other for better for worse, in a way informal
but sufficiently effective. This was the beginning of a union which
lasted for the length of a generation and more, down to the day of
Rousseau's most tragical ending.<a name="FNanchor122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122">[122]</a> She thought she saw in him a worthy
soul; and he was convinced that he saw in her a woman of
sensibility, simple and free from trick, and neither of the two, he
says, was deceived in respect of the other. Her intellectual
quality was unique. She could never be taught to read with any
approach to success. She could never follow the order of the twelve
months of the year, nor master a single arithmetical figure, nor
count a sum of money, nor reckon the price of a thing. A month's
instruction was not enough to give knowledge of the hours of the
day on the dial-plate. The words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.108" id="Page_i.108">[i.108]</a></span> she used were often the direct
opposites of the words that she meant to use.<a name="FNanchor123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123">[123]</a></p>
<p>The marriage choice of others is the inscrutable puzzle of those
who have no eye for the fact that such choice is the great match of
cajolery between purpose and invisible hazard; the blessedness of
many lives is the stake, as intention happens to cheat accident or
to be cheated by it. When the match is once over, deep criticism of
a game of pure chance is time wasted. The crude talk in which the
unwise deliver their judgments upon the conditions of success in
the relations between men and women, has flowed with unprofitable
copiousness as to this not very inviting case. People construct an
imaginary Rousseau out of his writings, and then fetter their
elevated, susceptible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.109" id="Page_i.109">[i.109]</a></span> sensitive, and humane creation, to the
unfortunate woman who could never be taught that April is the month
after March, or that twice four and a half are nine. Now we have
already seen enough of Rousseau to know for how infinitely little
he counted the gift of a quick wit, and what small store he set
either on literary varnish or on capacity for receiving it. He was
touched in people with whom he had to do, not by attainment, but by
moral fibre or his imaginary impression of their moral fibre.
Instead of analysing a character, bringing its several elements
into the balance, computing the more or less of this faculty or
that, he loved to feel its influence as a whole, indivisible,
impalpable, playing without sound or agitation around him like soft
light and warmth and the fostering air. The deepest ignorance, the
dullest incapacity, the cloudiest faculties of apprehension, were
nothing to him in man or woman, provided he could only be sensible
of that indescribable emanation from voice and eye and movement,
that silent effusion of serenity around spoken words, which nature
has given to some tranquillising spirits, and which would have left
him free in an even life of indolent meditation and unfretted
sense. A woman of high, eager, stimulating kind would have been a
more fatal mate for him than the most stupid woman that ever
rivalled the stupidity of man. Stimulation in any form always meant
distress to Rousseau. The moist warmth of the Savoy valleys was not
dearer to him than the subtle inhalations of softened and close
enveloping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.110" id="Page_i.110">[i.110]</a></span> companionship, in which the one needful thing is not
intellectual equality, but easy, smooth, constant contact of
feeling about the thousand small matters that make up the existence
of a day. This is not the highest ideal of union that one's mind
can conceive from the point of view of intense productive energy,
but Rousseau was not concerned with the conditions of productive
energy. He only sought to live, to be himself, and he knew better
than any critics can know for him, what kind of nature was the best
supplement for his own. As he said in an apophthegm with a deep
melancholy lying at the bottom of it,&#8212;you never can cite the
example of a thoroughly happy man, for no one but the man himself
knows anything about it.<a name="FNanchor124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124">[124]</a> &quot;By the side of people we love,&quot; he says
very truly, &quot;sentiment nourishes the intelligence as well as the
heart, and we have little occasion to seek ideas elsewhere. I lived
with my Theresa as pleasantly as with the finest genius in the
universe.&quot;<a name="FNanchor125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125">[125]</a></p>
<p>Theresa Le Vasseur would probably have been happier if she had
married a stout stable-boy, as indeed she did some thirty years
hence by way of gathering up the fragments that were left; but
there is little reason to think that Rousseau would have been much
happier with any other mate than he was with Theresa. There was no
social disparity between the two. She was a person accustomed to
hardship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.111" id="Page_i.111">[i.111]</a></span> and coarseness, and so was he. And he always
systematically preferred the honest coarseness of the plain people
from whom he was sprung and among whom he had lived, to the more
hateful coarseness of heart which so often lurks under fine manners
and a complete knowledge of the order of the months in the year and
the arithmetical table. Rousseau had been a serving-man, and there
was no deterioration in going with a serving-woman.<a name="FNanchor126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126">[126]</a> However this
may be, it is certain that for the first dozen years or so of his
partnership&#8212;and many others as well as he are said to have found
in this term a limit to the conditions of the original
contract,&#8212;Rousseau had perfect and entire contentment in the
Theresa whom all his friends pronounced as mean, greedy, jealous,
degrading, as she was avowedly brutish in understanding. Granting
that she was all these things, how much of the responsibility for
his acts has been thus shifted from the shoulders of Rousseau
himself, whose connection with her was from beginning to end
entirely voluntary? If he attached himself deliberately to an
unworthy object by a bond which he was indisputably free to break
on any day that he chose, were not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.112" id="Page_i.112">[i.112]</a></span> effects of such a union as
much due to his own character which sought, formed, and perpetuated
it, as to the character of Theresa Le Vasseur? Nothing, as he
himself said in a passage to which he appends a vindication of
Theresa, shows the true leanings and inclinations of a man better
than the sort of attachments which he forms.<a name="FNanchor127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127">[127]</a></p>
<p>It is a natural blunder in a literate and well-mannered society
to charge a mistake against a man who infringes its conventions in
this particular way. Rousseau knew what he was about, as well as
politer persons. He was at least as happy with his kitchen wench as
Addison was with his countess, or Voltaire with his marchioness,
and he would not have been what he was, nor have played the part
that he did play in the eighteenth century, if he had felt anything
derogatory or unseemly in a kitchen wench. The selection was
probably not very deliberate; as it happened, Theresa served as a
standing illustration of two of his most marked traits, a contempt
for mere literary culture, and a yet deeper contempt for social
accomplishments and social position. In time he found out the
grievous disadvantages of living in solitude with a companion who
did not know how to think, and whose stock of ideas was so slight
that the only common ground of talk between them was gossip and
quodlibets. But her lack of sprightliness, beauty, grace,
refinement, and that gentle initiative by which women may make even
a sombre life so various,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.113" id="Page_i.113">[i.113]</a></span> went for nothing with him. What his
friends missed in her, he did not seek and would not have valued;
and what he found in her, they were naturally unable to appreciate,
for they never were in the mood for detecting it. &quot;I have not seen
much of happy men,&quot; he wrote when near his end, &quot;perhaps nothing;
but I have many a time seen contented hearts, and of all the
objects that have struck me, I believe it is this which has always
given most contentment to myself.&quot;<a name="FNanchor128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128">[128]</a> This moderate conception of felicity,
which was always so characteristic with him, as an even, durable,
and rather low-toned state of the feelings, accounts for his
prolonged acquiescence in a companion whom men with more elation in
their ideal would assuredly have found hostile even to the most
modest contentment.</p>
<p>&quot;The heart of my Theresa,&quot; he wrote long after the first
tenderness had changed into riper emotion on his side, and, alas,
into indifference on hers, &quot;was that of an angel; our attachment
waxed stronger with our intimacy, and we felt more and more each
day that we were made for one another. If our pleasures could be
described, their simplicity would make you laugh; our excursions
together out of town, in which I would munificently expend eight or
ten halfpence in some rural tavern; our modest suppers at my
window, seated in front of one another on two small chairs placed
on a trunk that filled up the breadth of the embrasure. Here the
window did duty for a table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.114" id="Page_i.114">[i.114]</a></span> we breathed the fresh air, we could
see the neighbourhood and the people passing by, and though on the
fourth story, could look down into the street as we ate. Who shall
describe, who shall feel the charms of those meals, consisting of a
coarse quartern loaf, some cherries, a tiny morsel of cheese, and a
pint of wine which we drank between us? Ah, what delicious
seasoning there is in friendship, confidence, intimacy, gentleness
of soul! We used sometimes to remain thus until midnight, without
once thinking of the time.&quot;<a name="FNanchor129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129">[129]</a></p>
<p>Men and women are often more fairly judged by the way in which
they bear the burden of what they have done, than by the prime act
which laid the burden on their lives.<a name="FNanchor130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130">[130]</a> The deeper
part of us shows in the manner of accepting consequences. On the
whole, Rousseau's relations with this woman present him in a better
light than those with any other person whatever. If he became with
all the rest of the world suspicious, angry, jealous, profoundly
diseased in a word, with her he was habitually trustful,
affectionate, careful, most long-suffering. It sometimes even
occurs to us that his constancy to Theresa was only another side of
the morbid perversity of his relations with the rest of the world.
People of a certain kind not seldom make the most serious and vital
sacrifices for bare love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.115" id="Page_i.115">[i.115]</a></span> of singularity, and a man like Rousseau
was not unlikely to feel an eccentric pleasure in proving that he
could find merit in a woman who to everybody else was desperate.
One who is on bad terms with the bulk of his fellows may contrive
to save his self-respect and confirm his conviction that they are
all in the wrong, by preserving attachment to some one to whom
general opinion is hostile; the private argument being that if he
is capable of this degree of virtue and friendship in an
unfavourable case, how much more could he have practised it with
others, if they would only have allowed him. Whether this kind of
apology was present to his mind or not, Rousseau could always refer
those who charged him with black caprice, to his steady kindness
towards Theresa Le Vasseur. Her family were among the most odious
of human beings, greedy, idle, and ill-humoured, while her mother
had every fault that a woman could have in Rousseau's eyes,
including that worst fault of setting herself up for a fine wit.
Yet he bore with them all for years, and did not break with Madame
Le Vasseur until she had poisoned the mind of her daughter, and
done her best by rapacity and lying to render him contemptible to
all his friends.</p>
<p>In the course of years Theresa herself gave him unmistakable
signs of a change in her affections. &quot;I began to feel,&quot; he says, at
a date of sixteen or seventeen years from our present point, &quot;that
she was no longer for me what she had been in our happy years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.116" id="Page_i.116">[i.116]</a></span> and
I felt it all the more clearly as I was still the same towards
her.&quot;<a name="FNanchor131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131">[131]</a>
This was in 1762, and her estrangement grew deeper and her
indifference more open, until at length, seven years afterwards, we
find that she had proposed a separation from him. What the exact
reasons for this gradual change may have been we do not know, nor
have we any right in ignorance of the whole facts to say that they
were not adequate and just. There are two good traits recorded of
the woman's character. She could never console herself for having
let her father be taken away to end his days miserably in a house
of charity.<a name="FNanchor132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132">[132]</a> And the repudiation of her children,
against which the glowing egoism of maternity always rebelled,
remained a cruel dart in her bosom as long as she lived. We may
suppose that there was that about household life with Rousseau
which might have bred disgusts even in one as little fastidious as
Theresa was. Among other things which must have been hard to
endure, we know that in composing his works he was often weeks
together without speaking a word to her.<a name="FNanchor133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133">[133]</a> Perhaps again
it would not be difficult to produce some passages in Rousseau's
letters and in the Confessions, which show traces of that subtle
contempt for women that lurks undetected in many who would blush to
avow it. Whatever the causes may have been, from indifference she
passed to something like aversion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.117" id="Page_i.117">[i.117]</a></span> in the one place where a
word of complaint is wrung from him, he describes her as rending
and piercing his heart at a moment when his other miseries were at
their height. His patience at any rate was inexhaustible; now old,
worn by painful bodily infirmities, racked by diseased suspicion
and the most dreadful and tormenting of the minor forms of madness,
nearly friendless, and altogether hopeless, he yet kept unabated
the old tenderness of a quarter of a century before, and expressed
it in words of such gentleness, gravity, and self-respecting
strength, as may touch even those whom his books leave unmoved, and
who view his character with deepest distrust. &quot;For the
six-and-twenty years, dearest, that our union has lasted, I have
never sought my happiness except in yours, and have never ceased to
try to make you happy; and you saw by what I did lately,<a name="FNanchor134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134">[134]</a> that your
honour and happiness were one as dear to me as the other. I see
with pain that success does not answer my solicitude, and that my
kindness is not as sweet to you to receive, as it is sweet to me to
show. I know that the sentiments of honour and uprightness with
which you were born will never change in you; but as for those of
tenderness and attachment which were once reciprocal between us, I
feel that they now only exist on my side. Not only, dearest of all
friends, have you ceased to find pleasure in my company, but you
have to tax yourself severely even to remain a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.118" id="Page_i.118">[i.118]</a></span> with me
out of complaisance. You are at your ease with all the world but
me. I do not speak to you of many other things. We must take our
friends with their faults, and I ought to pass over yours, as you
pass over mine. If you were happy with me I could be content, but I
see clearly that you are not, and this is what makes my heart sore.
If I could do better for your happiness, I would do it and hold my
peace; but that is not possible. I have left nothing undone that I
thought would contribute to your felicity. At this moment, while I
am writing to you, overwhelmed with distress and misery, I have no
more true or lively desire than to finish my days in closest union
with you. You know my lot,&#8212;it is such as one could not even dare
to describe, for no one could believe it. I never had, my dearest,
other than one single solace, but that the sweetest; it was to pour
out all my heart in yours; when I talked of my miseries to you,
they were soothed; and when you had pitied me, I needed pity no
more. My every resource, my whole confidence, is in you and in you
only; my soul cannot exist without sympathy, and cannot find
sympathy except with you. It is certain that if you fail me and I
am forced to live alone, I am as a dead man. But I should die a
thousand times more cruelly still, if we continued to live together
in misunderstanding, and if confidence and friendship were to go
out between us. It would be a hundred times better to cease to see
each other; still to live, and sometimes to regret one another.
Whatever sacrifice may be necessary on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.119" id="Page_i.119">[i.119]</a></span> my part to make you happy,
be so at any cost, and I shall be content. We have faults to weep
over and to expiate, but no crimes; let us not blot out by the
imprudence of our closing days the sweetness and purity of those we
have passed together.&quot;<a name="FNanchor135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135">[135]</a> Think ill as we may of Rousseau's
theories, and meanly as we may of some parts of his conduct, yet to
those who can feel the pulsing of a human life apart from a man's
formul&#230;, and can be content to leave to sure circumstance the
tragic retaliation for evil behaviour, this letter is like one of
the great master's symphonies, whose theme falls in soft strokes of
melting pity on the heart. In truth, alas, the union of this now
diverse pair had been stained by crimes shortly after its
beginning. In the estrangement of father and mother in their late
years we may perhaps hear the rustle and spy the pale forms of the
avenging spectres of their lost children.</p>
<p>At the time when the connection with Theresa Le Vasseur was
formed, Rousseau did not know how to gain bread. He composed the
musical diversion of the Muses Galantes, which Rameau rightly or
wrongly pronounced a plagiarism, and at the request of Richelieu he
made some minor re-adaptations in Voltaire's Princesse de Navarre,
which Rameau had set to music&#8212;that &quot;farce of the fair&quot; to which
the author of Za&#239;re owed his seat in the Academy.<a name="FNanchor136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136">[136]</a> But neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.120" id="Page_i.120">[i.120]</a></span>
task brought him money, and he fell back on a sort of
secretaryship, with perhaps a little of the valet in it, to Madame
Dupin and her son-in-law, M. de Francueil, for which he received
the too moderate income of nine hundred francs. On one occasion he
returned to his room expecting with eager impatience the arrival of
a remittance, the proceeds of some small property which came to him
by the death of his father.<a name="FNanchor137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137">[137]</a> He found the letter, and was opening it
with trembling hands, when he was suddenly smitten with shame at
his want of self-control; he placed it unopened on the
chimney-piece, undressed, slept better than usual, and when he
awoke the next morning, he had forgotten all about the letter until
it caught his eye. He was delighted to find that it contained his
money, but &quot;I can swear,&quot; he adds, &quot;that my liveliest delight was
in having conquered myself.&quot; An occasion for self-conquest on a
more considerable scale was at hand. In these tight straits, he
received grievous news from the unfortunate Theresa. He made up his
mind cheerfully what to do; the mother acquiesced after sore
persuasion and with bitter tears; and the new-born child was
dropped into oblivion in the box of the asylum for foundlings. Next
year the same easy expedient was again resorted to, with the same
heedlessness on the part of the father, the same pain and
reluctance on the part of the mother. Five children in all were
thus put away, and with such entire absence of any precaution with
a view to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.121" id="Page_i.121">[i.121]</a></span> identification in happier times, that not even a
note was kept of the day of their birth.<a name="FNanchor138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138">[138]</a></p>
<p>People have made a great variety of remarks upon this
transaction, from the economist who turns it into an illustration
of the evil results of hospitals for foundlings in encouraging
improvident unions, down to the theologian who sees in it new proof
of the inborn depravity of the human heart and the fall of man.
Others have vindicated it in various ways, one of them courageously
taking up the ground that Rousseau had good reason to believe that
the children were not his own, and therefore was fully warranted in
sending the poor creatures kinless into the universe.<a name="FNanchor139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139">[139]</a> Perhaps it is
not too transcendental a thing to hope that civilisation may one
day reach a point when a plea like this shall count for an
aggravation rather than a palliative; when a higher conception of
the duties of humanity, familiarised by the practice of adoption as
well as by the spread of both rational and compassionate
considerations as to the blameless little ones, shall have expelled
what is surely as some red and naked beast's emotion of fatherhood.
What may be an excellent reason for repudiating a woman, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.122" id="Page_i.122">[i.122]</a></span> never
be a reason for abandoning a child, except with those whom reckless
egoism has made willing to think it a light thing to fling away
from us the moulding of new lives and the ensuring of salutary
nurture for growing souls.</p>
<p>We are, however, dispensed from entering into these questions of
the greater morals by the very plain account which the chief actor
has given us, almost in spite of himself. His crime like most
others was the result of heedlessness, of the overriding of duty by
the short dim-eyed selfishness of the moment. He had been
accustomed to frequent a tavern, where the talk turned mostly upon
topics which men with much self-respect put as far from them, as
men with little self-respect will allow them to do. &quot;I formed my
fashion of thinking from what I perceived to reign among people who
were at bottom extremely worthy folk, and I said to myself, Since
it is the usage of the country, as one lives here, one may as well
follow it. So I made up my mind to it cheerfully, and without the
least scruple.&quot;<a name="FNanchor140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140">[140]</a> By and by he proceeded to cover this
nude and intelligible explanation with finer phrases, about
preferring that his children should be trained up as workmen and
peasants rather than as adventurers and fortune-hunters, and about
his supposing that in sending them to the hospital for foundlings
he was enrolling himself a citizen in Plato's Republic.<a name="FNanchor141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141">[141]</a> This is hardly
more than the talk of one become famous, who is defending the acts
of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.123" id="Page_i.123">[i.123]</a></span> obscurity on the high principles which fame requires. People
do not turn citizens of Plato's Republic &quot;cheerfully and without
the least scruple,&quot; and if a man frequents company where the
despatch of inconvenient children to the hospital was an accepted
point of common practice, it is superfluous to drag Plato and his
Republic into the matter. Another turn again was given to his
motives when his mind had become clouded by suspicious mania.
Writing a year or two before his death he had assured himself that
his determining reason was the fear of a destiny for his children a
thousand times worse than the hard life of foundlings, namely,
being spoiled by their mother, being turned into monsters by her
family, and finally being taught to hate and betray their father by
his plotting enemies.<a name="FNanchor142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142">[142]</a> This is obviously a mixture in his mind
of the motives which led to the abandonment of the children and
justified the act to himself at the time, with the circumstances
that afterwards reconciled him to what he had done; for now he
neither had any enemies plotting against him, nor did he suppose
that he had. As for his wife's family, he showed himself quite
capable, when the time came, of dealing resolutely and shortly with
their importunities in his own case, and he might therefore well
have trusted his power to deal with them in the case of his
children. He was more right when in 1770, in his important letter
to M. de St. Germain, he admitted that example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.124" id="Page_i.124">[i.124]</a></span> necessity, the
honour of her who was dear to him, all united to make him entrust
his children to the establishment provided for that purpose, and
kept him from fulfilling the first and holiest of natural duties.
&quot;In this, far from excusing, I accuse myself; and when my reason
tells me that I did what I ought to have done in my situation, I
believe that less than my heart, which bitterly belies it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143">[143]</a> This
coincides with the first undisguised account given in the
Confessions, which has been already quoted, and it has not that
flawed ring of cant and fine words which sounds through nearly all
his other references to this great stain upon his life, excepting
one, and this is the only further document with which we need
concern ourselves. In that,<a name="FNanchor144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144">[144]</a> which was written while the unholy work
was actually being done, he states very distinctly that the motives
were those which are more or less closely connected with most
unholy works, motives of money&#8212;the great instrument and measure of
our personal convenience, the quantitative test of our self-control
in placing personal convenience behind duty to other people. &quot;If my
misery and my misfortunes rob me of the power of fulfilling a duty
so dear, that is a calamity to pity me for, rather than a crime to
reproach me with. I owe them subsistence, and I procured a better
or at least a surer subsistence for them than I could myself have
provided; this condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.125" id="Page_i.125">[i.125]</a></span>tion is above all others.&quot; Next comes the
consideration of their mother, whose honour must be kept. &quot;You know
my situation; I gained my bread from day to day painfully enough;
how then should I feed a family as well? And if I were compelled to
fall back on the profession of author, how would domestic cares and
the confusion of children leave me peace of mind enough in my
garret to earn a living? Writings which hunger dictates are hardly
of any use, and such a resource is speedily exhausted. Then I
should have to resort to patronage, to intrigue, to tricks ... in
short to surrender myself to all those infamies, for which I am
penetrated with such just horror. Support myself, my children, and
their mother on the blood of wretches? No, madame, it were better
for them to be orphans than to have a scoundrel for their
father.... Why have I not married, you will ask? Madame, ask it of
your unjust laws. It was not fitting for me to contract an eternal
engagement; and it will never be proved to me that my duty binds me
to it. What is certain is that I have never done it, and that I
never meant to do it. But we ought not to have children when we
cannot support them. Pardon me, madame; nature means us to have
offspring, since the earth produces sustenance enough for all; but
it is the rich, it is your class, which robs mine of the bread of
my children.... I know that foundlings are not delicately nurtured;
so much the better for them, they become more robust. They have
nothing superfluous given to them, but they have everything that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.126" id="Page_i.126">[i.126]</a></span>
necessary. They do not make gentlemen of them, but peasants or
artisans.... They would not know how to dance, or ride on
horseback, but they would have strong unwearied legs. I would
neither make authors of them, nor clerks; I would not practise them
in handling the pen, but the plough, the file, and the plane,
instruments for leading a healthy, laborious, innocent life.... I
deprived myself of the delight of seeing them, and I have never
tasted the sweetness of a father's embrace. Alas, as I have already
told you, I see in this only a claim on your pity, and I deliver
them from misery at my own expense.&quot;<a name="FNanchor145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145">[145]</a> We may see
here that Rousseau's sophistical eloquence, if it misled others,
was at least as powerful in misleading himself, and it may be noted
that this letter, with its talk of the children of the rich taking
bread out of the mouths of the children of the poor, contains the
first of those socialistic sentences by which the writer in after
times gained so famous a name. It is at any rate clear from this
that the real motive of the abandonment of the children was wholly
material. He could not afford to maintain them, and he did not wish
to have his comfort disturbed by their presence.</p>
<p>There is assuredly no word to be said by any one with firm
reason and unsophisticated conscience in extenuation of this crime.
We have only to remember that a great many other persons in that
lax time, when the structure of the family was undermined alike in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.127" id="Page_i.127">[i.127]</a></span>
practice and speculation, were guilty of the same crime; that
Rousseau, better than they, did not erect his own criminality into
a social theory, but was tolerably soon overtaken by a remorse
which drove him both to confess his misdeed, and to admit that it
was inexpiable; and that the atrocity of the offence owes half the
blackness with which it has always been invested by wholesome
opinion, to the fact that the offender was by and by the author of
the most powerful book by which parental duty has been commended in
its full loveliness and nobility. And at any rate, let Rousseau be
a little free from excessive reproach from all clergymen,
sentimentalists, and others, who do their worst to uphold the
common and rather bestial opinion in favour of reckless
propagation, and who, if they do not advocate the despatch of
children to public institutions, still encourage a selfish
incontinence which ultimately falls in burdens on others than the
offenders, and which turns the family into a scene of squalor and
brutishness, producing a kind of parental influence that is far
more disastrous and demoralising than the absence of it in public
institutions can possibly be. If the propagation of children
without regard to their maintenance be either a virtue or a
necessity, and if afterwards the only alternatives are their
maintenance in an asylum on the one hand, and their maintenance in
the degradation of a poverty-stricken home on the other, we should
not hesitate to give people who act as Rousseau acted, all that
credit for self-denial and high moral courage which he so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.128" id="Page_i.128">[i.128]</a></span>
audaciously claimed for himself. It really seems to be no more
criminal to produce children with the deliberate intention of
abandoning them to public charity, as Rousseau did, than it is to
produce them in deliberate reliance on the besotted maxim that he
who sends mouths will send meat, or any other of the spurious saws
which make Providence do duty for self-control, and add to the
gratification of physical appetite the grotesque luxury of
religious unction.</p>
<p>In 1761 the Mar&#233;chale de Luxembourg made efforts to
discover Rousseau's children, but without success. They were gone
beyond hope of identification, and the author of <i>Emitius</i> and
his sons and daughters lived together in this world, not knowing
one another. Rousseau with singular honesty did not conceal his
satisfaction at the fruitlessness of the charitable endeavours to
restore them to him. &quot;The success of your search,&quot; he wrote, &quot;could
not give me pure and undisturbed pleasure; it is too late, too
late.... In my present condition this search interested me more for
another person [Theresa] than myself; and considering the too
easily yielding character of the person in question, it is possible
that what she had found already formed for good or for evil, might
turn out a sorry boon to her.&quot;<a name="FNanchor146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146">[146]</a> We may doubt, in spite of one or two
charming and graceful passages, whether Rousseau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.129" id="Page_i.129">[i.129]</a></span> was of a nature to
have any feeling for the pathos of infancy, the bright blank eye,
the eager unpurposed straining of the hand, the many turns and
changes in murmurings that yet can tell us nothing. He was both too
self-centred and too passionate for warm ease and fulness of life
in all things, to be truly sympathetic with a condition whose
feebleness and immaturity touch us with half-painful hope.</p>
<p>Rousseau speaks in the Confessions of having married Theresa
five-and-twenty years after the beginning of their
acquaintance,<a name="FNanchor147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147">[147]</a> but we hardly have to understand that
any ceremony took place which anybody but himself would recognise
as constituting a marriage. What happened appears to have been
this. Seated at table with Theresa and two guests, one of them the
mayor of the place, he declared that she was his wife. &quot;This good
and seemly engagement was contracted,&quot; he says, &quot;in all the
simplicity but also in all the truth of nature, in the presence of
two men of worth and honour.... During the short and simple act, I
saw the honest pair melted in tears.&quot;<a name="FNanchor148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148">[148]</a> He had at
this time whimsically assumed the name of Renou, and he wrote to a
friend that of course he had married in this name, for he adds,
with the characteristic insertion of an irrelevant bit of
magniloquence, &quot;it is not names that are married; no, it is
persons.&quot; &quot;Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.130" id="Page_i.130">[i.130]</a></span> if in this simple and holy ceremony names entered
as a constituent part, the one I bear would have sufficed, since I
recognise no other. If it were a question of property to be
assured, then it would be another thing, but you know very well
that is not our case.&quot;<a name="FNanchor149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149">[149]</a> Of course, this may have been a
marriage according to the truth of nature, and Rousseau was as free
to choose his own rites as more sacramental performers, but it is
clear from his own words about property that there was no pretence
of a marriage in law. He and Theresa were on profoundly
uncomfortable terms about this time,<a name="FNanchor150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150">[150]</a> and Rousseau
is not the only person by many thousands who has deceived himself
into thinking that some form of words between man and woman must
magically transform the substance of their characters and lives,
and conjure up new relations of peace and steadfastness.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>We have, however, been outstripping slow-footed destiny, and
have now to return to the time when Theresa did not drink brandy,
nor run after stable-boys, nor fill Rousseau's soul with bitterness
and suspicion, but sat contentedly with him in an evening taking a
stoic's meal in the window of their garret on the fourth floor,
seasoning it with &quot;confidence, intimacy, gentleness of soul,&quot; and
that general comfort of sensation which, as we know to our cost, is
by no means an invariable condition either of duty done externally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.131" id="Page_i.131">[i.131]</a></span>
or of spiritual growth within. It is perhaps hard for us to feel
that we are in the presence of a great religious reactionist; there
is so little sign of the higher graces of the soul, there are so
many signs of the lowering clogs of the flesh. But the spirit of a
man moves in mysterious ways, and expands like the plants of the
field with strange and silent stirrings. It is one of the chief
tests of worthiness and freedom from vulgarity of soul in us, to be
able to have faith that this expansion is a reality, and the most
important of all realities. We do not rightly seize the type of
Socrates if we can never forget that he was the husband of
Xanthippe, nor David's if we can only think of him as the murderer
of Uriah, nor Peter's if we can simply remember that he denied his
master. Our vision is only blindness, if we can never bring
ourselves to see the possibilities of deep mystic aspiration behind
the vile outer life of a man, or to believe that this coarse
Rousseau, scantily supping with his coarse mate, might yet have
many glimpses of the great wide horizons that are haunted by
figures rather divine than human.</p>

Musset-Pathay (ii. 72) quotes the passage from Lord Chesterfield's

with whom his son might in a regular and business-like manner open
the elevating game of gallant intrigue.</p>
<p><a name="Footnote_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor109">[109]</a> M.
Dupin deserves honourable mention as having helped the editors of

salt-works (D'Alembert's <i>Discours Pr&#233;liminaire</i>). His
son M. Dupin de Francueil, it may be worth noting, is a link in the
genealogical chain between two famous personages. In 1777, the year
before Rousseau's death, he married (in the chapel of the French
embassy in London) Aurora de Saxe, a natural daughter of the
marshal, himself the natural son of August the Strong, King of
Poland. From this union was born Maurice Dupin, and Maurice Dupin
was the father of Madame George Sand. M. Francueil died in
1787.</p>

H&#244;tel St. Quentin, rue des Cordiers, a narrow street running
between the rue St. Jacques and the rue Victor Cousin. The still
squalid hostelry is now visible as H&#244;tel J.J. Rousseau. There
is some doubt whether he first saw Theresa in 1743 or 1745. The
account in Bk. vii. of the <i>Confessions</i> is for the latter
date (see also <i>Corr.</i>, ii. 207), but in the well-known letter
to her in 1769 (<i>Ib.</i> vi. 79), he speaks of the twenty-six
years of their union. Their so-called marriage took place in 1768,
and writing in that year he speaks of the five-and-twenty years of
their attachment (<i>Ib.</i> v. 323), and in the <i>Confessions</i>
(ix. 249) he fixes their marriage at the same date; also in the
letter to Saint-Germain (vi. 152). Musset-Pathay, though giving
1745 in one place (i. 45), and 1743 in another (ii. 198), has with
less than his usual care paid no attention to the discrepancy.</p>

<i>Conf.</i>, vii. 101. A short specimen of her composition may be
interesting, at any rate to hieroglyphic students: &quot;Mesiceuras

getou gour e rus pour vous, e qui neu finiraes quotobocs ces mon
quere qui vous paleu ces paes mes le vre ... ge sui avestous
lamities e la reu conec caceu posible e la tacheman mon cher
bonnamies votreau enble e bon amiess theress le vasseur.&quot; Of which
dark words this is the interpretation:&#8212;&quot;Mais il sera encore mieux
remis quand je sera aupr&#232;s de vous, et de vous
t&#233;moigner toute la joie et la tendresse de mon coeur que

humble et bonne amie, Th&#233;r&#232;se Le Vasseur.&quot;
(<i>Rousseau, ses Amis et ses Ennemis</i>, ii. 450.) Certainly it
was not learning and arts which hindered Theresa's manners from
being pure.</p>

houses of Madame Vercellis, Count Gouvon, and even Madame de

Geneva, of nearly every bourgeois virtue and bourgeois

ten or a dozen years; but one or two of the provincial cities, such
as Bordeaux, Rouen, Dijon, had possessed academies in imitation of
the greater body of Paris for a much longer time. Their activity
covered a very varied ground, from the mere commonplaces of
literature to the most practical details of material production. If
they now and then relapsed into inquiries about the laws of Crete,
they more often discussed positive and scientific theses, and
rather resembled our chambers of agriculture than bodies of more
learned pretension. The academy of Dijon was one of the earliest of
these excellent institutions, and on the whole the list of its
theses shows it to have been among the most sensible in respect of
the subjects which it found worth thinking about. Its members,
however, could not entirely resist the intellectual atmosphere of
the time. In 1742 they invited discussion of the point, whether the
natural law can conduct society to perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.133" id="Page_i.133">[i.133]</a></span> without the aid of
political laws.<a name="FNanchor151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151">[151]</a> In 1749 they proposed this question as a
theme for their prize essay: <i>Has the restoration of the sciences
contributed to purify or to corrupt manners?</i> Rousseau was one
of fourteen competitors, and in 1750 his discussion of the academic
theme received the prize.<a name="FNanchor152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152">[152]</a> This was his first entry on the field of
literature and speculation. Three years afterwards the same academy
propounded another question: <i>What is the origin of inequality
among men, and is it authorised by the natural law?</i> Rousseau
again competed, and though his essay neither gained the prize, nor
created as lively an agitation as its predecessor had done, yet we
may justly regard the second as a more powerful supplement to the
first.</p>
<p>It is always interesting to know the circumstances under which
pieces that have moved a world were originally composed, and
Rousseau's account of the generation of his thoughts as to the
influence of enlightenment on morality, is remarkable enough to be
worth transcribing. He was walking along the road from Paris to
Vincennes one hot summer afternoon on a visit to Diderot, then in
prison for his Letter on the Blind (1749), when he came across in a
newspaper the announcement of the theme propounded by the Dijon
academy. &quot;If ever anything resembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.134" id="Page_i.134">[i.134]</a></span> a sudden inspiration, it was
the movement which began in me as I read this. All at once I felt
myself dazzled by a thousand sparkling lights; crowds of vivid
ideas thronged into my mind with a force and confusion that threw
me into unspeakable agitation; I felt my head whirling in a
giddiness like that of intoxication. A violent palpitation
oppressed me; unable to walk for difficulty of breathing, I sank
under one of the trees of the avenue, and passed half an hour there
in such a condition of excitement, that when I arose I saw that the
front of my waistcoat was all wet with my tears, though I was
wholly unconscious of shedding them. Ah, if I could ever have
written the quarter of what I saw and felt under that tree, with
what clearness should I have brought out all the contradictions of
our social system; with what simplicity I should have demonstrated
that man is good naturally, and that by institutions only is he
made bad.&quot;<a name="FNanchor153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153">[153]</a> Diderot encouraged him to compete for
the prize, and to give full flight to the ideas which had come to
him in this singular way.<a name="FNanchor154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154">[154]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.135" id="Page_i.135">[i.135]</a></span></p>

<p>People have held up their hands at the amazing originality of
the idea that perhaps sciences and arts have not purified manners.
This sentiment is surely exaggerated, if we reflect first that it
occurred to the academicians of Dijon as a question for discussion,
and second that, if you are asked whether a given result has or has
not followed from certain circumstances, the mere form of the
question suggests No quite as readily as Yes. The originality lay
not in the central contention, but in the fervour, sincerity, and
conviction of a most unacademic sort with which it was presented
and enforced. There is less originality in denouncing your
generation as wicked and adulterous than there is in believing it
to be so, and in persuading the generation itself both that you
believe it and that you have good reasons to give. We have not to
suppose that there was any miracle wrought by agency celestial or
infernal in the sudden disclosure of his idea to Rousseau. Rousseau
had been thinking of politics ever since the working of the
government of Venice had first drawn his mind to the subject. What
is the government, he had kept asking himself, which is most proper
to form a sage and virtuous nation? What government by its nature
keeps closest to the law? What is this law? And whence?<a name="FNanchor155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155">[155]</a> This chain of
problems had led him to what he calls the historic study of
morality, though we may doubt whether history was so much his
teacher as the rather meagrely nourished handmaid of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.136" id="Page_i.136">[i.136]</a></span>
imagination. Here was the irregular preparation, the hidden
process, which suddenly burst into light and manifested itself with
an exuberance of energy, that passed to the man himself for an
inward revolution with no precursive sign.</p>
<p>Rousseau's ecstatic vision on the road to Vincennes was the
opening of a life of thought and production which only lasted a
dozen years, but which in that brief space gave to Europe a new
gospel. Emilius and the Social Contract were completed in 1761, and
they crowned a work which if you consider its origin, influence,
and meaning with due and proper breadth, is marked by signal unity
of purpose and conception. The key to it is given to us in the
astonishing transport at the foot of the wide-spreading oak. Such a
transport does not come to us of cool and rational western
temperament, but more often to the oriental after lonely sojourning
in the wilderness, or in violent reactions on the road to Damascus
and elsewhere. Jean Jacques detected oriental quality in his own
nature,<a name="FNanchor156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156">[156]</a>
and so far as the union of ardour with mysticism, of intense
passion with vague dream, is to be defined as oriental, he
assuredly deserves the name. The ideas stirred in his mind by the
Dijon problem suddenly &quot;opened his eyes, brought order into the
chaos in his head, revealed to him another universe. From the
active effervescence which thus began in his soul, came sparks of
genius which people saw glittering in his writings through ten
years of fever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.137" id="Page_i.137">[i.137]</a></span> and delirium, but of which no trace had been seen in
him previously, and which would probably have ceased to shine
henceforth, if he should have chanced to wish to continue writing
after the access was over. Inflamed by the contemplation of these
lofty objects, he had them incessantly present to his mind. His
heart, made hot within him by the idea of the future happiness of
the human race, and by the honour of contributing to it, dictated
to him a language worthy of so high an enterprise ... and for a
moment, he astonished Europe by productions in which vulgar souls
saw only eloquence and brightness of understanding, but in which
those who dwell in the ethereal regions recognised with joy one of
their own.&quot;<a name="FNanchor157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157">[157]</a></p>
<p>This was his own account of the matter quite at the end of his
life, and this is the only point of view from which we are secure
against the vulgarity of counting him a deliberate hypocrite and
conscious charlatan. He was possessed, as holier natures than his
have been, by an enthusiastic vision, an intoxicated confidence, a
mixture of sacred rage and prodigious love, an insensate but
absolutely disinterested revolt against the stone and iron of a
reality which he was bent on melting in a heavenly blaze of
splendid aspiration and irresistibly persuasive expression. The
last word of this great expansion was Emilius, its first and more
imperfectly articulated was the earlier of the two Discourses.</p>
<p>Rousseau's often-repeated assertion that here was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.138" id="Page_i.138">[i.138]</a></span> the instant of
the ruin of his life, and that all his misfortunes flowed from that
unhappy moment, has been constantly treated as the word of
affectation and disguised pride. Yet, vain as he was, it may well
have represented his sincere feeling in those better moods when
mental suffering was strong enough to silence vanity. His visions
mastered him for these thirteen years, <i>grande mortalis oevi
spatium</i>. They threw him on to that turbid sea of literature for
which he had so keen an aversion, and from which, let it be
remarked, he fled finally away, when his confidence in the ease of
making men good and happy by words of monition had left him. It was
the torment of his own enthusiasm which rent that veil of placid
living, that in his normal moments he would fain have interposed
between his existence and the tumult of a generation with which he
was profoundly out of sympathy. In this way the first Discourse was
the letting in of much evil upon him, as that and the next and the
Social Contract were the letting in of much evil upon all
Europe.</p>
<p>Of this essay the writer has recorded his own impression that,
though full of heat and force, it is absolutely wanting in logic
and order, and that of all the products of his pen, it is the
feeblest in reasoning and the poorest in numbers and harmony.
&quot;For,&quot; as he justly adds, &quot;the art of writing is not learnt all at
once.&quot;<a name="FNanchor158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158">[158]</a>
The modern critic must be content to accept the same verdict; only
a generation so in love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.139" id="Page_i.139">[i.139]</a></span> as this was with anything that could tickle
its intellectual curiousness, would have found in the first of the
two Discourses that combination of speculative and literary merit
which was imputed to Rousseau on the strength of it, and which at
once brought him into a place among the notables of an age that was
full of them.<a name="FNanchor159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159">[159]</a> We ought to take in connection with it
two at any rate of the vindications of the Discourse, which the
course of controversy provoked from its author, and which serve to
complete its significance. It is difficult to analyse, because in
truth it is neither closely argumentative, nor is it vertebrate,
even as a piece of rhetoric. The gist of the piece, however, runs
somewhat in this wise:&#8212;</p>
<p>Before art had fashioned our manners, and taught our passions to
use a too elaborate speech, men were rude but natural, and
difference of conduct announced at a glance difference of
character. To-day a vile and most deceptive uniformity reigns over
our manners, and all minds seem as if they had been cast in a
single mould. Hence we never know with what sort of person we are
dealing, hence the hateful troop of suspicions, fears, reserves,
and treacheries, and the concealment of impiety, arrogance,
calumny, and scepticism, under a dangerous varnish of refinement.
So terrible a set of effects must have a cause. History shows that
the cause here is to be found in the progress of sciences and arts.
Egypt, once so mighty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.140" id="Page_i.140">[i.140]</a></span> becomes the mother of philosophy and the
fine arts; straightway behold its conquest by Cambyses, by Greeks,
by Romans, by Arabs, finally by Turks. Greece twice conquered Asia,
once before Troy, once in its own homes; then came in fatal
sequence the progress of the arts, the dissolution of manners, and
the yoke of the Macedonian. Rome, founded by a shepherd and raised
to glory by husbandmen, began to degenerate with Ennius, and the
eve of her ruin was the day when she gave a citizen the deadly
title of arbiter of good taste. China, where letters carry men to
the highest dignities of the state, could not be preserved by all
her literature from the conquering power of the ruder Tartar. On
the other hand, the Persians, Scythians, Germans, remain in history
as types of simplicity, innocence, and virtue. Was not he
admittedly the wisest of the Greeks, who made of his own apology a
plea for ignorance, and a denunciation of poets, orators, and
artists? The chosen people of God never cultivated the sciences,
and when the new law was established, it was not the learned, but
the simple and lowly, fishers and workmen, to whom Christ entrusted
his teaching and its ministry.<a name="FNanchor160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160">[160]</a></p>
<p>This, then, is the way in which chastisement has always
overtaken our presumptuous efforts to emerge from that happy
ignorance in which eternal wisdom placed us; though the thick veil
with which that wisdom has covered all its operations seemed to
warn us that we were not destined to fatuous research.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.141" id="Page_i.141">[i.141]</a></span> All the
secrets that Nature hides from us are so many evils against which
she would fain shelter us.</p>
<p>Is probity the child of ignorance, and can science and virtue be
really inconsistent with one another? These sounding contrasts are
mere deceits, because if you look nearly into the results of this
science of which we talk so proudly, you will perceive that they
confirm the results of induction from history. Astronomy, for
instance, is born of superstition; geometry from the desire of
gain; physics from a futile curiosity; all of them, even morals,
from human pride. Are we for ever to be the dupes of words, and to
believe that these pompous names of science, philosophy, and the
rest, stand for worthy and profitable realities?<a name="FNanchor161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161">[161]</a> Be sure that
they do not.</p>
<p>How many errors do we pass through on our road to truth, errors
a thousandfold more dangerous than truth is useful? And by what
marks are we to know truth, when we think that we have found it?
And above all, if we do find it, who of us can be sure that he will
make good use of it? If celestial intelligences cultivated science,
only good could result; and we may say as much of great men of the
stamp of Socrates, who are born to be the guides of others.<a name="FNanchor162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162">[162]</a> But the
intelligences of common men are neither celestial nor Socratic.</p>
<p>Again, every useless citizen may be fairly regarded as a
pernicious man; and let us ask those illustrious philosophers who
have taught us what insects repro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.142" id="Page_i.142">[i.142]</a></span>duce themselves curiously, in what
ratio bodies attract one another in space, what curves have
conjugate points, points of inflection or reflection, what in the
planetary revolutions are the relations of areas traversed in equal
times&#8212;let us ask those who have attained all this sublime
knowledge, by how much the worse governed, less flourishing, or
less perverse we should have been if they had attained none of it?
Now if the works of our most scientific men and best citizens lead
to such small utility, tell us what we are to think of the crowd of
obscure writers and idle men of letters who devour the public
substance in pure loss.</p>
<p>Then it is in the nature of things that devotion to art leads to
luxury, and luxury, as we all know from our own experience, no less
than from the teaching of history, saps not only the military
virtues by which nations preserve their independence, but also
those moral virtues which make the independence of a nation worth
preserving. Your children go to costly establishments where they
learn everything except their duties. They remain ignorant of their
own tongue, though they will speak others not in use anywhere in
the world; they gain the faculty of composing verses which they can
barely understand; without capacity to distinguish truth from
error, they possess the art of rendering them indistinguishable to
others by specious arguments. Magnanimity, equity, temperance,
courage, humanity, have no real meaning to them; and if they hear
speak of God, it breeds more terror than awful fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.143" id="Page_i.143">[i.143]</a></span></p>

<p>Whence spring all these abuses, if not from the disastrous
inequality introduced among men by the distinction of talents and
the cheapening of virtue?<a name="FNanchor163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163">[163]</a> People no longer ask of a man whether he
has probity, but whether he is clever; nor of a book whether it is
useful, but whether it is well written. And after all, what is this
philosophy, what are these lessons of wisdom, to which we give the
prize of enduring fame? To listen to these sages, would you not
take them for a troop of charlatans, all bawling out in the
market-place, Come to me, it is only I who never cheat you, and
always give good measure? One maintains that there is no body, and
that everything is mere representation; the other that there is no
entity but matter, and no God but the universe: one that moral good
and evil are chimeras; the other that men are wolves and may devour
one another with the easiest conscience in the world. These are the
marvellous personages on whom the esteem of contemporaries is
lavished so long as they live, and to whom immortality is reserved
after their death. And we have now invented the art of making their
extravagances eternal, and thanks to the use of typographic
characters the dangerous speculations of Hobbes and Spinoza will
endure for ever. Surely when they perceive the terrible disorders
which printing has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.144" id="Page_i.144">[i.144]</a></span> already caused in Europe, sovereigns will take
as much trouble to banish this deadly art from their states as they
once took to introduce it.</p>
<p>If there is perhaps no harm in allowing one or two men to give
themselves up to the study of sciences and arts, it is only those
who feel conscious of the strength required for advancing their
subjects, who have any right to attempt to raise monuments to the
glory of the human mind. We ought to have no tolerance for those
compilers who rashly break open the gate of the sciences, and
introduce into their sanctuary a populace that is unworthy even to
draw near to it. It may be well that there should be philosophers,
provided only and always that the people do not meddle with
philosophising.<a name="FNanchor164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164">[164]</a></p>
<p>In short, there are two kinds of ignorance: one brutal and
ferocious, springing from a bad heart, multiplying vices, degrading
the reason, and debasing the soul: the other &quot;a reasonable
ignorance, which consists in limiting our curiosity to the extent
of the faculties we have received; a modest ignorance, born of a
lively love for virtue, and inspiring indifference only for what is
not worthy of filling a man's heart, or fails to contribute to its
improvement; a sweet and precious ignorance, the treasure of a pure
soul at peace with itself, which finds all its blessedness in
inward retreat, in testifying to itself its own innocence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.145" id="Page_i.145">[i.145]</a></span>
which feels no need of seeking a warped and hollow happiness in the
opinion of other people as to its enlightenment.&quot;<a name="FNanchor165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165">[165]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>Some of the most pointed assaults in this Discourse, such for
instance as that on the pedantic parade of wit, or that on the
excessive preponderance of literary instruction in the art of
education, are due to Montaigne; and in one way, the Discourse
might be described as binding together a number of that shrewd
man's detached hints by means of a paradoxical generalisation. But
the Rousseau is more important than the Montaigne in it. Another
remark to be made is that its vigorous disparagement of science, of
the emptiness of much that is called science, of the deadly pride
of intellect, is an anticipation in a very precise way of the
attitude taken by the various Christian churches and their
representatives now and for long, beginning with De Maistre, the
greatest of the religious reactionaries after Rousseau. The
vilification of the Greeks is strikingly like some vehement
passages in De Maistre's estimate of their share in sophisticating
European intellect. At last Rousseau even began to doubt whether
&quot;so chattering a people could ever have had any solid virtues, even
in primitive times.&quot;<a name="FNanchor166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166">[166]</a> Yet Rousseau's own thinking about
society is deeply marked with opinions borrowed exactly from these
very chatterers. His imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.146" id="Page_i.146">[i.146]</a></span> was fascinated from the first by
the freedom and boldness of Plato's social speculations, to which
his debt in a hundred details of his political and educational
schemes is well known. What was more important than any obligation
of detail was the fatal conception, borrowed partly from the Greeks
and partly from Geneva, of the omnipotence of the Lawgiver in
moulding a social state after his own purpose and ideal. We shall
presently quote the passage in which he holds up for our envy and
imitation the policy of Lycurgus at Sparta, who swept away all that
he found existing and constructed the social edifice afresh from
foundation to roof.<a name="FNanchor167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167">[167]</a> It is true that there was an
unmistakable decay of Greek literary studies in France from the
beginning of the eighteenth century, and Rousseau seems to have
read Plato only through Ficinus's translation. But his example and
its influence, along with that of Mably and others, warrant the
historian in saying that at no time did Greek ideas more keenly
preoccupy opinion than during this century.<a name="FNanchor168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168">[168]</a> Perhaps we may
say that Rousseau would never have proved how little learning and
art do for the good of manners, if Plato had not insisted on poets
being driven out of the Republic. The article on Political Economy,
written by him for the Encyclop&#230;dia (1755), rings with the
names of ancient rulers and lawgivers; the project of public
education is recommended by the example of Cretans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.147" id="Page_i.147">[i.147]</a></span>
Laced&#230;monians, and Persians, while the propriety of the
reservation of a state domain is suggested by Romulus.</p>
<p>It may be added that one of the not too many merits of the essay
is the way in which the writer, more or less in the Socratic
manner, insists on dragging people out of the refuge of sonorous
general terms, with a great public reputation of much too
well-established a kind to be subjected to the affront of analysis.
It is true that Rousseau himself contributed nothing directly to
that analytic operation which Socrates likened to midwifery, and he
set up graven images of his own in place of the idols which he
destroyed. This, however, did not wholly efface the distinction,
which he shares with all who have ever tried to lead the minds of
men into new tracks, of refusing to accept the current coins of
philosophical speech without test or measurement. Such a treatment
of the great trite words which come so easily to the tongue and
seem to weigh for so much, must always be the first step towards
bringing thought back into the region of real matter, and
confronting phrases, terms, and all the common form of the
discussion of an age, with the actualities which it is the object
of sincere discussion to penetrate.</p>
<p>The refutation of many parts of Rousseau's main contention on
the principles which are universally accepted among enlightened men
in modern society is so extremely obvious that to undertake it
would merely be to draw up a list of the gratulatory common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.148" id="Page_i.148">[i.148]</a></span>places
of which we hear quite enough in the literature and talk of our
day. In this direction, perhaps it suffices to say that the
Discourse is wholly one-sided, admitting none of the conveniences,
none of the alleviations of suffering of all kinds, nothing of the
increase of mental stature, which the pursuit of knowledge has
brought to the race. They may or may not counterbalance the evils
that it has brought, but they are certainly to be put in the
balance in any attempt at philosophic examination of the subject.
It contains no serious attempt to tell us what those alleged evils
really are, or definitely to trace them one by one, to abuse of the
thirst for knowledge and defects in the method of satisfying it. It
omits to take into account the various other circumstances, such as
climate, government, race, and the disposition of neighbours, which
must enter equally with intellectual progress into whatever
demoralisation has marked the destinies of a nation. Finally it has
for the base of its argument the entirely unsupported assumption of
there having once been in the early history of each society a stage
of mild, credulous, and innocent virtue, from which appetite for
the fruit of the forbidden tree caused an inevitable degeneration.
All evidence and all scientific analogy are now well known to lead
to the contrary doctrine, that the history of civilisation is a
history of progress and not of decline from a primary state. After
all, as Voltaire said to Rousseau in a letter which only showed a
superficial appreciation of the real drift of the argument, we must
confess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.149" id="Page_i.149">[i.149]</a></span> that these thorns attached to literature are only as
flowers in comparison with the other evils that have deluged the
earth. &quot;It was not Cicero nor Lucretius nor Virgil nor Horace, who
contrived the proscriptions of Marius, of Sulla, of the debauched
Antony, of the imbecile Lepidus, of that craven tyrant basely
surnamed Augustus. It was not Marot who produced the St.
Bartholomew massacre, nor the tragedy of the Cid that led to the
wars of the Fronde. What really makes, and always will make, this
world into a valley of tears, is the insatiable cupidity and
indomitable insolence of men, from Kouli Khan, who did not know how
to read, down to the custom-house clerk, who knows nothing but how
to cast up figures. Letters nourish the soul, they strengthen its
integrity, they furnish a solace to it,&quot;&#8212;and so on in the sense,
though without the eloquence, of the famous passage in Cicero's
defence of Archias the poet.<a name="FNanchor169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169">[169]</a> All this, however, in our time is in no
danger of being forgotten, and will be present to the mind of every
reader. The only danger is that pointed out by Rousseau himself:
&quot;People always think they have described what the sciences do, when
they have in reality only described what the sciences ought to
do.&quot;<a name="FNanchor170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170">[170]</a></p>
<p>What we are more likely to forget is that Rousseau's piece has a
positive as well as a negative side, and presents, in however
vehement and overstated a way, a truth which the literary and
speculative enthu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.150" id="Page_i.150">[i.150]</a></span>siasm of France in the eighteenth century, as is
always the case with such enthusiasm whenever it penetrates either
a generation or an individual, was sure to make men dangerously
ready to forget.<a name="FNanchor171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171">[171]</a> This truth may be put in different
terms. We may describe it as the possibility of eminent civic
virtue existing in people, without either literary taste or science
or speculative curiosity. Or we may express it as the compatibility
of a great amount of contentment and order in a given social state,
with a very low degree of knowledge. Or finally, we may give the
truth its most general expression, as the subordination of all
activity to the promotion of social aims. Rousseau's is an
elaborate and roundabout manner of saying that virtue without
science is better than science without virtue; or that the
well-being of a country depends more on the standard of social duty
and the willingness of citizens to conform to it, than on the
standard of intellectual culture and the extent of its diffusion.
In other words, we ought to be less concerned about the speculative
or scientific curiousness of our people than about the height of
their notion of civic virtue and their firmness and persistency in
realising it. It is a moralist's way of putting the ancient
preacher's monition, that they are but empty in whom is not the
wisdom of God. The importance of stating this is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.151" id="Page_i.151">[i.151]</a></span> our modern era
always pressing, because there is a constant tendency on the part
of energetic intellectual workers, first, to concentrate their
energies on a minute specialty, leaving public affairs and
interests to their own course. Second, they are apt to overestimate
their contributions to the stock of means by which men are made
happier, and what is more serious, to underestimate in comparison
those orderly, modest, self-denying, moral qualities, by which only
men are made worthier, and the continuity of society is made surer.
Third, in consequence of their greater command of specious
expression and their control of the organs of public opinion, they
both assume a kind of supreme place in the social hierarchy, and
persuade the majority of plain men unsuspectingly to take so very
egregious an assumption for granted. So far as Rousseau's Discourse
recalled the truth as against this sort of error it was full of
wholesomeness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately his indignation against the overweening
pretensions of the verse-writer, the gazetteer, and the great band
of socialists at large, led him into a general position with
reference to scientific and speculative energy, which seems to
involve a perilous misconception of the conditions of this energy
producing its proper results. It is easy now, as it was easy for
Rousseau in the last century, to ask in an epigrammatical manner by
how much men are better or happier for having found out this or
that novelty in transcendental mathematics, biology, or astronomy;
and this is very well as against the discoverer of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.152" id="Page_i.152">[i.152]</a></span> marvels
who shall give himself out for the benefactor of the human race.
But both historical experience and observation of the terms on
which the human intelligence works, show us that we can only make
sure of intellectual activity on condition of leaving it free to
work all round, in every department and in every remotest nook of
each department, and that its most fruitful epochs are exactly
those when this freedom is greatest, this curiosity most keen and
minute, and this waste, if you choose to call the indispensable
superfluity of force in a natural process waste, most copious and
unsparing. You will not find your highest capacity in
statesmanship, nor in practical science, nor in art, nor in any
other field where that capacity is most urgently needed for the
right service of life, unless there is a general and vehement
spirit of search in the air. If it incidentally leads to many
industrious futilities and much learned refuse, this is still the
sign and the generative element of industry which is not futile,
and of learning which is something more than mere water spilled
upon the ground.</p>
<p>We may say in fine that this first Discourse and its
vindications were a dim, shallow, and ineffective feeling after the
great truth, that the only normal state of society is that in which
neither the love of virtue has been thrust far back into a
secondary place by the love of knowledge, nor the active curiosity
of the understanding dulled, blunted, and made ashamed by soft,
lazy ideals of life as a life only of the affections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.153" id="Page_i.153">[i.153]</a></span> Rousseau now
and always fell into the opposite extreme from that against which
his whole work was a protest. We need not complain very loudly that
while remonstrating against the restless intrepidity of the
rationalists of his generation, he passed over the central truth,
namely that the full and ever festal life is found in active
freedom of curiosity and search taking significance, motive, force,
from a warm inner pulse of human love and sympathy. It was not
given to Rousseau to see all this, but it was given to him to see
the side of it for which the most powerful of the men living with
him had no eyes, and the first Discourse was only a moderately
successful attempt to bring his vision before Europe. It was said
at the time that he did not believe a word of what he had
written.<a name="FNanchor172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172">[172]</a>
It is a natural characteristic of an age passionately occupied with
its own set of ideas, to question either the sincerity or the
sanity of anybody who declares its sovereign conceptions to be no
better than foolishness. We cannot entertain such a suspicion.
Perhaps the vehemence of controversy carries him rather further
than he quite meant to go, when he declares that if he were a chief
of an African tribe, he would erect on his frontier a gallows, on
which he would hang without mercy the first European who should
venture to pass into his territory, and the first native who should
dare to pass out of it.<a name="FNanchor173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173">[173]</a> And there are many other extravagances
of illustration, but the main position is serious enough, as
represented in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.154" id="Page_i.154">[i.154]</a></span> emblematic vignette with which the essay was
printed&#8212;the torch of science brought to men by Prometheus, who
warns a satyr that it burns; the satyr, seeing fire for the first
time and being fain to embrace it, is the symbol of the vulgar men
who, seduced by the glitter of literature, insist on delivering
themselves up to its study.<a name="FNanchor174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174">[174]</a> Rousseau's whole doctrine hangs
compactly together, and we may see the signs of its growth after
leaving his hands in the crude formula of the first Discourse, if
we proceed to the more audacious paradox of the second.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>The Discourse on the Origin of Inequality among men opens with a
description of the natural state of man, which occupies
considerably more than half of the entire performance. It is
composed in a vein which is only too familiar to the student of the
literature of the time, picturing each habit and thought, and each
step to new habits and thoughts, with the minuteness, the fulness,
the precision, of one who narrates circumstances of which he has
all his life been the close eye-witness. The natural man reveals to
us every motive, every process internal and external, every
slightest circumstance of his daily life, and each element that
gradually transformed him into the non-natural man. One who had
watched bees or beetles for years could not give us a more full or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.155" id="Page_i.155">[i.155]</a></span>
confident account of their doings, their hourly goings in and out,
than it was the fashion in the eighteenth century to give of the
walk and conversation of the primeval ancestor. The conditions of
primitive man were discussed by very incompetent ladies and
gentlemen at convivial supper parties, and settled with complete
assurance.<a name="FNanchor175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175">[175]</a></p>
<p>Rousseau thought and talked about the state of nature because
all his world was thinking and talking about it. He used phrases
and formulas with reference to it which other people used. He
required no more evidence than they did, as to the reality of the
existence of the supposed set of conditions to which they gave the
almost sacramental name of state of nature. He never thought of
asking, any more than anybody else did in the middle of the
eighteenth century, what sort of proof, how strong, how direct, was
to be had, that primeval man had such and such habits, and changed
them in such a way and direction, and for such reasons. Physical
science had reached a stage by this time when its followers were
careful to ask questions about evidence, correct description,
verification. But the idea of accurate method had to be made very
familiar to men by the successes of physical science in the search
after truths of one kind, before the indispensableness of applying
it in the search after truths of all kinds had extended to the
science of the constitution and succession of social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.156" id="Page_i.156">[i.156]</a></span> states. In
this respect Rousseau was not guiltier than the bulk of his
contemporaries. Voltaire's piercing common sense, Hume's deep-set
sagacity, Montesquieu's caution, prevented them from launching very
far on to this metaphysical sea of nature and natural laws and
states, but none of them asked those critical questions in relation
to such matters which occur so promptly in the present day to
persons far inferior to them in intellectual strength. Rousseau
took the notion of the state of nature because he found it to his
hand; he fitted to it his own characteristic aspirations, expanding
and vivifying a philosophic conception with all the heat of humane
passion; and thus, although, at the end of the process when he had
done with it, the state of nature came out blooming as the rose, it
was fundamentally only the dry, current abstraction of his time,
artificially decorated to seduce men into embracing a strange ideal
under a familiar name.</p>
<p>Before analysing the Discourse on Inequality, we ought to make
some mention of a remarkable man whose influence probably reached
Rousseau in an indirect manner through Diderot; I mean
Morelly.<a name="FNanchor176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176">[176]</a>
In 1753 Morelly published a prose poem called the Basiliade,
describing the corruption of manners introduced by the errors of
the lawgiver, and pointing out how this corruption is to be amended
by return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.157" id="Page_i.157">[i.157]</a></span> the empire of nature and truth. He was no doubt
stimulated by what was supposed to be the central doctrine of
Montesquieu, then freshly given to the world, that it is government
and institutions which make men what they are. But he was
stimulated into a reaction, and in 1754 he propounded his whole
theory, in a piece which in closeness, consistency, and
thoroughness is admirably different from Rousseau's
rhetoric.<a name="FNanchor177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177">[177]</a> It lacked the sovereign quality of
persuasiveness, and so fell on deaf ears. Morelly accepts the
doctrine that men are formed by the laws, but insists that
moralists and statesmen have always led us wrong by legislating and
prescribing conduct on the false theory that man is bad, whereas he
is in truth a creature endowed with natural probity. Then he
strikes to the root of society with a directness that Rousseau
could not imitate, by the position that &quot;these laws by establishing
a monstrous division of the products of nature, and even of their
very elements&#8212;by dividing what ought to have remained entire, or
ought to have been restored to entireness if any accident had
divided them, aided and favoured the break-up of all sociability.&quot;
All political and all moral evils are the effects of this
pernicious cause&#8212;private property. He says of Rousseau's first
Discourse that the writer ought to have seen that the corruption of
manners which he set down to literature and art really came from
this venomous principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.158" id="Page_i.158">[i.158]</a></span> property, which infects all that it
touches.<a name="FNanchor178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178">[178]</a>
Christianity, it is true, assailed this principle and restored
equality or community of possessions, but Christianity had the
radical fault of involving such a detachment from earthly
affections, in order to deliver ourselves to heavenly meditation,
as brought about a necessary degeneration in social activity. The
form of government is a matter of indifference, provided you can
only assure community of goods. Political revolutions are at bottom
the clash of material interests, and until you have equalised the
one you will never prevent the other.<a name="FNanchor179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179">[179]</a></p>
<p>Let us turn from this very definite position to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.159" id="Page_i.159">[i.159]</a></span> of the least
definite productions to be found in all literature.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>It will seem a little odd that more than half of a discussion on
the origin of inequality among men should be devoted to a glowing
imaginary description, from which no reader could conjecture what
thesis it was designed to support. But we have only to remember
that Rousseau's object was to persuade people that the happier
state is that in which inequality does not subsist, that there had
once been such a state, and that this was first the state of
nature, and then the state only one degree removed from it, in
which we now find the majority of savage tribes. At the outset he
defines inequality as a word meaning two different things; one,
natural or physical inequality, such as difference of age, of
health, of physical strength, of attributes of intelligence and
character; the other, moral or political inequality, consisting in
difference of privileges which some enjoy to the detriment of the
rest, such as being richer, more honoured, more powerful. The
former differences are established by nature, the latter are
authorised, if they were not established, by the consent of
men.<a name="FNanchor180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180">[180]</a> In
the state of nature no inequalities flow from the differences among
men in point of physical advantage and disadvantage, and which
remain without derivative differences so long as the state of
nature endures undisturbed. Nature deals with men as the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.160" id="Page_i.160">[i.160]</a></span>
Sparta dealt with the children of its citizens; she makes those who
are well constituted strong and robust, and she destroys all the
rest.</p>
<p>The surface of the earth is originally covered by dense forest,
and inhabited by animals of every species. Men, scattered among
them, imitate their industry, and so rise to the instinct of the
brutes, with this advantage that while each species has only its
own, man, without anything special, appropriates the instincts of
all. This admirable creature, with foes on every side, is forced to
be constantly on the alert, and hence to be always in full
possession of all his faculties, unlike civilised man, whose native
force is enfeebled by the mechanical protections with which he has
surrounded himself. He is not afraid of the wild beasts around him,
for experience has taught him that he is their master. His health
is better than ours, for we live in a time when excess of idleness
in some, excess of toil in others, the heating and over-abundant
diet of the rich, the bad food of the poor, the orgies and excesses
of every kind, the immoderate transport of every passion, the
fatigue and strain of spirit,&#8212;when all these things have inflicted
more disorders upon us than the vaunted art of medicine has been
able to keep pace with. Even if the sick savage has only nature to
hope from, on the other hand he has only his own malady to be
afraid of. He has no fear of death, for no animal can know what
death is, and the knowledge of death and its terrors is one of the
first of man's terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.161" id="Page_i.161">[i.161]</a></span> acquisitions after abandoning his animal
condition.<a name="FNanchor181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181">[181]</a> In other respects, such as protection
against weather, such as habitation, such as food, the savage's
natural power of adaptation, and the fact that his demands are
moderate in proportion to his means of satisfying them, forbid us
to consider him physically unhappy. Let us turn to the intellectual
and moral side.</p>
<p>If you contend that men were miserable, degraded, and outcast
during these primitive centuries because the intelligence was
dormant, then do not forget, first, that you are drawing an
indictment against nature,&#8212;no trifling blasphemy in those
days&#8212;and second, that you are attributing misery to a free
creature with tranquil spirit and healthy body, and that must
surely be a singular abuse of the term. We see around us scarcely
any but people who complain of the burden of their lives; but who
ever heard of a savage in full enjoyment of his liberty ever
dreaming of complaint about his life or of self-destruction?</p>
<p>With reference to virtues and vices in a state of nature, Hobbes
is wrong in declaring that man in this state is vicious, as not
knowing virtue. He is not vicious, for the reason that he does not
know what being good is. It is not development of enlightenment nor
the restrictions of law, but the calm of the passions and ignorance
of vice, which keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.162" id="Page_i.162">[i.162]</a></span> them from doing ill. <i>Tanto plus in illis
profitcit vitiorum ignoratio, quam in his cognitio
virtutis.</i></p>
<p>Besides man has one great natural virtue, that of pity, which
precedes in him the use of reflection, and which indeed he shares
with some of the brutes. Mandeville, who was forced to admit the
existence of this admirable quality in man, was absurd in not
perceiving that from it flow all the social virtues which he would
fain deny. Pity is more energetic in the primitive condition than
it is among ourselves. It is reflection which isolates one. It is
philosophy which teaches the philosopher to say secretly at sight
of a suffering wretch, Perish if it please thee; I am safe and
sound. They may be butchering a fellow-creature under your window;
all you have to do is to clap your hands to your ears, and argue a
little with yourself to hinder nature in revolt from making you
feel as if you were in the case of the victim.<a name="FNanchor182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182">[182]</a> The savage man
has not got this odious gift. In the state of nature it is pity
that takes the place of laws, manners, and virtue. It is in this
natural sentiment rather than in subtle arguments that we have to
seek the reluctance that every man would feel to do ill, even
without the precepts of education.<a name="FNanchor183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183">[183]</a></p>
<p>Finally, the passion of love, which produces such disasters in a
state of society, where the jealousy of lovers and the vengeance of
husbands lead each day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.163" id="Page_i.163">[i.163]</a></span> to duels and murders, where the duty of
eternal fidelity only serves to occasion adulteries, and where the
law of continence necessarily extends the debauching of women and
the practice of procuring abortion<a name="FNanchor184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184">[184]</a>&#8212;this passion
in a state of nature, where it is purely physical, momentary, and
without any association of durable sentiment with the object of it,
simply leads to the necessary reproduction of the species and
nothing more.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us conclude, then, that wandering in the forests, without
industry, without speech, without habitation, without war, without
connection of any kind, without any need of his fellows or without
any desire to harm them, perhaps even without ever recognising one
of them individually, savage man, subject to few passions and
sufficing to himself, had only the sentiments and the enlightenment
proper to his condition. He was only sensible of his real wants,
and only looked because he thought he had an interest in seeing;
and his intelligence made no more progress than his vanity. If by
chance he hit on some discovery, he was all the less able to
communicate it; as he did not know even his own children. An art
perished with its inventor. There was neither education nor
progress; generations multiplied uselessly; and as each generation
always started from the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.164" id="Page_i.164">[i.164]</a></span> point, centuries glided away in all
the rudeness of the first ages, the race was already old, the
individual remained always a child.&quot;</p>
<p>This brings us to the point of the matter. For if you compare
the prodigious diversities in education and manner of life which
reign in the different orders of the civil condition, with the
simplicity and uniformity of the savage and animal life, where all
find nourishment in the same articles of food, live in the same
way, and do exactly the same things, you will easily understand to
what degree the difference between man and man must be less in the
state of nature than in that of society.<a name="FNanchor185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185">[185]</a> Physical
inequality is hardly perceived in the state of nature, and its
indirect influences there are almost non-existent.</p>
<p>Now as all the social virtues and other faculties possessed by
man potentially were not bound by anything inherent in him to
develop into actuality, he might have remained to all eternity in
his admirable and most fitting primitive condition, but for the
fortuitous concurrence of a variety of external changes. What are
these different changes, which may perhaps have perfected human
reason, while they certainly have deteriorated the race, and made
men bad in making them sociable?</p>
<p>What, then, are the intermediary facts between the state of
nature and the state of civil society, the nursery of inequality?
What broke up the happy uniformity of the first times? First,
difference in soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.165" id="Page_i.165">[i.165]</a></span> in climate, in seasons, led to corresponding
differences in men's manner of living. Along the banks of rivers
and on the shores of the sea, they invented hooks and lines, and
were eaters of fish. In the forests they invented bows and arrows,
and became hunters. In cold countries they covered themselves with
the skins of beasts. Lightning, volcanoes, or some happy chance
acquainted them with fire, a new protection against the rigours of
winter. In company with these natural acquisitions, grew up a sort
of reflection or mechanical prudence, which showed them the kind of
precautions most necessary to their security. From this rudimentary
and wholly egoistic reflection there came a sense of the existence
of a similar nature and similar interests in their
fellow-creatures. Instructed by experience that the love of
well-being and comfort is the only motive of human actions, the
savage united with his neighbours when union was for their joint
convenience, and did his best to blind and outwit his neighbours
when their interests were adverse to his own, and he felt himself
the weaker. Hence the origin of certain rude ideas of mutual
obligation.<a name="FNanchor186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186">[186]</a></p>
<p>Soon, ceasing to fall asleep under the first tree, or to
withdraw into caves, they found axes of hard stone, which served
them to cut wood, to dig the ground, and to construct hovels of
branches and clay. This was the epoch of a first revolution, which
formed the establishment and division of families, and which
introduced a rough and partial sort of property.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.166" id="Page_i.166">[i.166]</a></span> Along with
rudimentary ideas of property, though not connected with them, came
the rudimentary forms of inequality. When men were thrown more
together, then he who sang or danced the best, the strongest, the
most adroit, or the most eloquent, acquired the most
consideration&#8212;that is, men ceased to take uniform and equal place.
And with the coming of this end of equality there passed away the
happy primitive immunity from jealousy, envy, malice, hate.</p>
<p>On the whole, though men had lost some of their original
endurance, and their natural pity had already undergone a certain
deterioration, this period of the development of the human
faculties, occupying a just medium between the indolence of the
primitive state and the petulant activity of our modern self-love,
must have been at once the happiest and the most durable epoch. The
more we reflect, the more evident we find it that this state was
the least subject to revolutions and the best for man. &quot;So long as
men were content with their rustic hovels, so long as they confined
themselves to stitching their garments of skin with spines or fish
bones, to decking their bodies with feathers and shells and
painting them in different colours, to perfecting and beautifying
their bows and arrows&#8212;in a word, so long as they only applied
themselves to works that one person could do, and to arts that
needed no more than a single hand, then they lived free, healthy,
good, and happy, so far as was compatible with their natural
constitution, and continued to enjoy among themselves the sweetness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.167" id="Page_i.167">[i.167]</a></span>
of independent intercourse. But from the moment that one man had
need of the help of another, as soon as they perceived it to be
useful for one person to have provisions for two, then equality
disappeared, property was introduced, labour became necessary, and
the vast forests changed into smiling fields, which had to be
watered by the sweat of men, and in which they ever saw bondage and
misery springing up and growing ripe with the harvests.&quot;<a name="FNanchor187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187">[187]</a></p>
<p>The working of metals and agriculture have been the two great
agents in this revolution. For the poet it is gold and silver, but
for the philosopher it is iron and corn, that have civilised men
and undone the human race. It is easy to see how the latter of the
two arts was suggested to men by watching the reproducing processes
of vegetation. It is less easy to be sure how they discovered
metal, saw its uses, and invented means of smelting it, for nature
had taken extreme precautions to hide the fatal secret. It was
probably the operation of some volcano which first suggested the
idea of fusing ore. From the fact of land being cultivated its
division followed, and therefore the institution of property in its
full shape. From property arose civil society. &quot;The first man who,
having enclosed a piece of ground, could think of saying, <i>This
is mine</i>, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the
real founder of civil society. How many crimes, wars, murders,
miseries, and horrors would not have been spared to the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.168" id="Page_i.168">[i.168]</a></span> race
by one who, plucking up the stakes, or filling in the trench,
should have called out to his fellows: Beware of listening to this
impostor; you are undone if you forget that the earth belongs to no
one, and that its fruits are for all.&quot;<a name="FNanchor188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188">[188]</a></p>
<p>Things might have remained equal even in this state, if talents
had only been equal, and if for example the employment of iron and
the consumption of agricultural produce had always exactly balanced
one another. But the stronger did more work; the cleverer got more
advantage from his work; the more ingenious found means of
shortening his labour; the husbandman had more need of metal, or
the smith more need of grain; and while working equally, one got
much gain, and the other could scarcely live. This distinction
between Have and Have-not led to confusion and revolt, to
brigandage on the one side and constant insecurity on the
other.</p>
<p>Hence disorders of a violent and interminable kind, which gave
rise to the most deeply designed project that ever entered the
human mind. This was to employ in favour of property the strength
of the very persons who attacked it, to inspire them with other
maxims, and to give them other institutions which should be as
favourable to property as natural law had been contrary to it. The
man who conceived this project, after showing his neighbours the
monstrous confusion which made their lives most burdensome, spoke
in this wise: &quot;Let us unite to shield the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.169" id="Page_i.169">[i.169]</a></span> weak from oppression, to
restrain the proud, and to assure to each the possession of what
belongs to him; let us set up rules of justice and peace, to which
all shall be obliged to conform, without respect of persons, and
which may repair to some extent the caprices of fortune, by
subjecting the weak and the mighty alike to mutual duties. In a
word, instead of turning our forces against one another, let us
collect them into one supreme power to govern us by sage laws, to
protect and defend all the members of the association, repel their
common foes, and preserve us in never-ending concord.&quot; This, and
not the right of conquest, must have been the origin of society and
laws, which threw new chains round the poor and gave new might to
the rich; and for the profit of a few grasping and ambitious men,
subjected the whole human race henceforth and for ever to toil and
bondage and wretchedness without hope.</p>
<p>The social constitution thus propounded and accepted was
radically imperfect from the outset, and in spite of the efforts of
the sagest lawgivers, it has always remained imperfect, because it
was the work of chance, and because, inasmuch as it was ill begun,
time, while revealing defects and suggesting remedies, could never
repair its vices; <i>people went on incessantly repairing and
patching, instead of which it was indispensable to begin by making
a clean surface and by throwing aside all the old materials, just
as Lycurgus did in Sparta</i>.</p>
<p>Put shortly, the main positions are these. In the state of
nature each man lived in entire isolation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.170" id="Page_i.170">[i.170]</a></span> therefore physical
inequality was as if it did not exist. After many centuries,
accident, in the shape of difference of climate and external
natural conditions, enforcing for the sake of subsistence some
degree of joint labour, led to an increase of communication among
men, to a slight development of the reasoning and reflective
faculties, and to a rude and simple sense of mutual obligation, as
a means of greater comfort in the long run. The first state was
good and pure, but the second state was truly perfect. It was
destroyed by a fresh succession of chances, such as the discovery
of the arts of metal-working and tillage, which led first to the
institution of property, and second to the prominence of the
natural or physical inequalities, which now began to tell with
deadly effectiveness. These inequalities gradually became summed up
in the great distinction between rich and poor; and this
distinction was finally embodied in the constitution of a civil
society, expressly adapted to consecrate the usurpation of the
rich, and to make the inequality of condition between them and the
poor eternal.</p>
<p>We thus see that the Discourse, unlike Morelly's terse
exposition, contains no clear account of the kind of inequality
with which it deals. Is it inequality of material possession or
inequality of political right? Morelly tells you decisively that
the latter is only an accident, flowing from the first; that the
key to renovation lies in the abolition of the first. Rousseau
mixes the two confusedly together under a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.171" id="Page_i.171">[i.171]</a></span> name, bemoans
each, but shrinks from a conclusion or a recommendation as to
either. He declares property to be the key to civil society, but
falls back from any ideas leading to the modification of the
institution lying at the root of all that he deplores.</p>
<p>The first general criticism, which in itself contains and covers
nearly all others, turns on Method. &quot;Conjectures become reasons
when they are the most likely that you can draw from the nature of
things,&quot; and &quot;it is for philosophy in lack of history to determine
the most likely facts.&quot; In an inductive age this royal road is
rigorously closed. Guesses drawn from the general nature of things
can no longer give us light as to the particular nature of the
things pertaining to primitive men, any more than such guesses can
teach us the law of the movement of the heavenly bodies, or the
foundations of jurisprudence. Nor can deduction from anything but
propositions which have themselves been won by laborious induction,
ever lead us to the only kind of philosophy which has fair
pretension to determine the most probable of the missing facts in
the chain of human history. That quantitative and differentiating
knowledge which is science, was not yet thought of in connection
with the movements of our own race upon the earth. It is to be
said, further, that of the two possible ways of guessing about the
early state, the conditions of advance from it, and the rest,
Rousseau's guess that all movement away from it has been towards
corruption, is less supported by subsequent knowledge than the
guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.172" id="Page_i.172">[i.172]</a></span> of his adversaries, that it has been a movement progressive
and upwards.</p>
<p>This much being said as to incurable vice of method, and there
are fervent disciples of Rousseau now living who will regard one's
craving for method in talking about men as a foible of pedantry, we
may briefly remark on one or two detached objections to Rousseau's
story. To begin with, there is no certainty as to there having ever
been a state of nature of a normal and organic kind, any more than
there is any one normal and typical state of society now. There are
infinitely diverse states of society, and there were probably as
many diverse states of nature. Rousseau was sufficiently acquainted
with the most recent metaphysics of his time to know that you
cannot think of a tree in general, nor of a triangle in general,
but only of some particular tree or triangle.<a name="FNanchor189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189">[189]</a> In a similar
way he might have known that there never was any such thing as a
state of nature in the general and abstract, fixed, typical, and
single. He speaks of the savage state also, which comes next, as
one, identical, normal. It is, of course, nothing of the kind. The
varieties of belief and habit and custom among the different tribes
of savages, in reference to every object that can engage their
attention, from death and the gods and immortality down to the uses
of marriage and the art of counting and the ways of procuring
subsistence, are infinitely numerous; and the more we know about
this vast diversity, the less easy is it to think of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.173" id="Page_i.173">[i.173]</a></span> savage
state in general. When Rousseau extols the savage state as the
veritable youth of the world, we wonder whether we are to think of
the negroes of the Gold Coast, or the Dyaks of Borneo, Papuans or
Maoris, Cheyennes or Tierra-del-Fuegians or the fabled Troglodytes;
whether in the veritable youth of the world they counted up to five
or only to two; whether they used a fire-drill, and if so what kind
of drill; whether they had the notion of personal identity in so
weak a shape as to practise the couvade; and a hundred other
points, which we should now require any writer to settle, who
should speak of the savage state as sovereign, one, and
indivisible, in the way in which Rousseau speaks of it, and holds
it up to our vain admiration.</p>
<p>Again, if the savage state supervened upon the state of nature
in consequence of certain climatic accidents of a permanent kind,
such as living on the banks of a river or in a dense forest, how
was it that the force of these accidents did not begin to operate
at once? How could the isolated state of nature endure for a year
in face of them? Or what was the precipitating incident which
suddenly set them to work, and drew the primitive men from an
isolation so profound that they barely recognised one another, into
that semi-social state in which the family was founded?</p>
<p>We cannot tell how the state of nature continued to subsist, or,
if it ever subsisted, how and why it ever came to an end, because
the agencies which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.174" id="Page_i.174">[i.174]</a></span> alleged to have brought it to an end must
have been coeval with the appearance of man himself. If gods had
brought to men seed, fire, and the mechanical arts, as in one of
the Platonic myths,<a name="FNanchor190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190">[190]</a> we could understand that there was a
long stage preliminary to these heavenly gifts. But if the gods had
no part nor lot in it, and if the accidents that slowly led the
human creature into union were as old as that nature, of which
indeed they were actually the component elements, then man must
have quitted the state of nature the very day on which he was born
into it. And what can be a more monstrous anachronism than to turn
a flat-headed savage into a clever, self-conscious, argumentative
utilitarian of the eighteenth century; working the social problem
out in his flat head with a keenness, a consistency, a grasp of
first principles, that would have entitled him to a chair in the
institute of moral sciences, and entering the social union with the
calm and reasonable deliberation of a great statesman taking a
critical step in policy? Aristotle was wiser when he fixed upon
sociability as an ultimate quality of human nature, instead of
making it, as Rousseau and so many others have done, the conclusion
of an unimpeachable train of syllogistic reasoning.<a name="FNanchor191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191">[191]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.175" id="Page_i.175">[i.175]</a></span> Morelly even,
his own contemporary, and much less of a sage than Aristotle, was
still sage enough to perceive that this primitive human machine,
&quot;though composed of intelligent parts, generally operates
independently of its reason; its deliberations are forestalled, and
only leave it to look on, while sentiment does its work.&quot;<a name="FNanchor192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192">[192]</a> It is the
more remarkable that Rousseau should have fallen into this kind of
error, as it was one of his distinctions to have perceived and
partially worked out the principle, that men guide their conduct
rather from passion and instinct than from reasoned
enlightenment.<a name="FNanchor193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193">[193]</a> The ultimate quality which he named pity
is, after all, the germ of sociability, which is only extended
sympathy. But he did not firmly adhere to this ultimate quality,
nor make any effort consistently to trace out its various
products.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.176" id="Page_i.176">[i.176]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not find, however, in Rousseau any serious attempt to
analyse the composition of human nature in its primitive stages.
Though constantly warning his readers very impressively against
confounding domesticated with primitive men, he practically assumes
that the main elements of character must always have been
substantially identical with such elements and conceptions as are
found after the addition of many ages of increasingly complex
experience. There is something worth considering in his notion that
civilisation has had effects upon man analogous to those of
domestication upon animals, but he lacked logical persistency
enough to enable him to adhere to his own idea, and work out
conclusions from it.</p>
<p>It might further be pointed out in another direction that he
takes for granted that the mode of advance into a social state has
always been one and the same, a single and uniform process, marked
by precisely the same set of several stages, following one another
in precisely the same order. There is no evidence of this; on the
contrary, evidence goes to show that civilisation varies in origin
and process with race and other things, and that though in all
cases starting from the prime factor of sociableness in man, yet
the course of its development has depended on the particular sets
of circumstances with which that factor has had to combine. These
are full of variety, according to climate and racial
predisposition, although, as has been justly said, the force of
both these two elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.177" id="Page_i.177">[i.177]</a></span> diminishes as the influence of the past in
giving consistency to our will becomes more definite, and our means
of modifying climate and race become better known. There is no sign
that Rousseau, any more than many other inquirers, ever reflected
whether the capacity for advance into the state of civil society in
any highly developed form is universal throughout the species, or
whether there are not races eternally incapable of advance beyond
the savage state. Progress would hardly be the exception which we
know it to be in the history of communities if there were not
fundamental diversities in the civilisable quality of races. Why do
some bodies of men get on to the high roads of civilisation, while
others remain in the jungle and thicket of savagery; and why do
some races advance along one of these roads, and others advance by
different roads?</p>
<p>Considerations of this sort disclose the pinched frame of trim
theory with which Rousseau advanced to set in order a huge mass of
boundlessly varied, intricate, and unmanageable facts. It is not,
however, at all worth while to extend such criticism further than
suffices to show how little his piece can stand the sort of
questions which may be put to it from a scientific point of view.
Nothing that Rousseau had to say about the state of nature was
seriously meant for scientific exposition, any more than the Sermon
on the Mount was meant for political economy. The importance of the
Discourse on Inequality lay in its vehement denunciation of the
existing social state.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.178" id="Page_i.178">[i.178]</a></span> To the writer the question of the origin of
inequality is evidently far less a matter at heart, than the
question of its results. It is the natural inclination of one
deeply moved by a spectacle of depravation in his own time and
country, to extol some other time or country, of which he is
happily ignorant enough not to know the drawbacks. Rousseau wrote
about the savage state in something of the same spirit in which
Tacitus wrote the Germania. And here, as in the Discourse on the
influence of science and art upon virtue, there is a positive side.
To miss this in resentment of the unscientific paradox that lies
about it, is to miss the force of the piece, and to render its
enormous influence for a generation after it was written
incomprehensible. We may always be quite sure that no set of ideas
ever produced this resounding effect on opinion, unless they
contained something which the social or spiritual condition of the
men whom they inflamed made true for the time, and true in an
urgent sense. Is it not tenable that the state of certain savage
tribes is more normal, offers a better balance between desire and
opportunity, between faculty and performance, than the permanent
state of large classes in western countries, the broken wreck of
civilisation?<a name="FNanchor194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194">[194]</a> To admit this is not to conclude, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.179" id="Page_i.179">[i.179]</a></span>
Rousseau so rashly concluded, that the movement away from the
primitive stages has been productive only of evil and misery even
to the masses of men, the hewers of wood and the drawers of water;
or that it was occasioned, and has been carried on by the
predominance of the lower parts and principles of human nature. Our
provisional acquiescence in the straitness and blank absence of
outlook or hope of the millions who come on to the earth that
greets them with no smile, and then stagger blindly under dull
burdens for a season, and at last are shovelled silently back under
the ground,&#8212;our acquiescence can only be justified in the sight of
humanity by the conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.180" id="Page_i.180">[i.180]</a></span> that this is one of the temporary
conditions of a vast process, working forwards through the impulse
and agency of the finer human spirits, but needing much blood, many
tears, uncounted myriads of lives, and immeasurable geologic
periods of time, for its high and beneficent consummation. There is
nothing surprising, perhaps nothing deeply condemnable, in the
burning anger for which this acquiescence is often changed in the
more impatient natures. As against the ignoble host who think that
the present ordering of men, with all its prodigious inequalities,
is in foundation and substance the perfection of social
blessedness, Rousseau was almost in the right. If the only
alternative to the present social order remaining in perpetuity
were a retrogression to some such condition as that of the
islanders of the South Sea, a lover of his fellow-creatures might
look upon the result, so far as it affected the happiness of the
bulk of them, with tolerably complete indifference. It is only the
faith that we are moving slowly away from the existing order, as
our ancestors moved slowly away from the old want of order, that
makes the present endurable, and makes any tenacious effort to
raise the future possible.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>An immense quantity of nonsense has been talked about the
equality of man, for which those who deny that doctrine and those
who assert it may divide the responsibility. It is in reality true
or false, according to the doctrines with which it is confronted.
As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.181" id="Page_i.181">[i.181]</a></span> against the theory that the existing way of sharing the
laboriously acquired fruits and delights of the earth is a just
representation and fair counterpart of natural inequalities among
men in merit and capacity, the revolutionary theory is true, and
the passionate revolutionary cry for equality of external chance
most righteous and unanswerable. But the issues do not end here.
Take such propositions as these:&#8212;there are differences in the
capacity of men for serving the community; the well-being of the
community demands the allotment of high function in proportion to
high faculty; the rights of man in politics are confined to a right
of the same protection for his own interests as is given to the
interests of others. As against these principles, the revolutionary
deductions from the equality of man are false. And such pretensions
as that every man could be made equally fit for every function, or
that not only each should have an equal chance, but that he who
uses his chance well and sociably should be kept on a level in
common opinion and trust with him who uses it ill and unsociably,
or does not use it at all,&#8212;the whole of this is obviously most
illusory and most disastrous, and in whatever decree any set of men
have ever taken it up, to that degree they have paid the
penalty.</p>
<p>What Rousseau's Discourse meant, what he intended it to mean,
and what his first direct disciples understood it as meaning, is
not that all men are born equal. He never says this, and his
recognition of natural inequality implies the contrary proposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.182" id="Page_i.182">[i.182]</a></span>
His position is that the artificial differences, springing from the
conditions of the social union, do not coincide with the
differences in capacity springing from original constitution; that
the tendency of the social union as now organised is to deepen the
artificial inequalities, and make the gulf between those endowed
with privileges and wealth and those not so endowed ever wider and
wider. It would have been very difficult a hundred years ago to
deny the truth of this way of stating the case. If it has to some
extent already ceased to be entirely true, and if violent popular
forces are at work making it less and less true, we owe the origin
of the change, among other causes and influences, not least to the
influence of Rousseau himself, and those whom he inspired. It was
that influence which, though it certainly did not produce, yet did
as certainly give a deep and remarkable bias, first to the American
Revolution, and a dozen years afterwards to the French
Revolution.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to trace the different fortunes which
awaited the idea of the equality of man in America and in France.
In America it has always remained strictly within the political
order, and perhaps with the considerable exception of the possibles
share it may have had, along with Christian notions of the
brotherhood of man, and statesmanlike notions of national
prosperity, in leading to the abolition of slavery, it has brought
forth no strong moral sentiment against the ethical and economic
bases of any part of the social order. In France, on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.183" id="Page_i.183">[i.183]</a></span>
hand, it was the starting-point of movements that have had all the
fervour and intensity of religions, and have made men feel about
social inequalities the burning shame and wrath with which a
Christian saw the flourishing temples of unclean gods. This
difference in the interpretation and development of the first
doctrine may be explained in various ways,&#8212;by difference of
material circumstance between America and France; difference of the
political and social level from which the principle of equality had
to start; and not least by difference of intellectual temperament.
This last was itself partly the product of difference in religion,
which makes the English dread the practical enforcement of logical
conclusions, while the French have hitherto been apt to dread and
despise any tendency to stop short of that.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p>Let us notice, finally, the important fact that the appearance
of Rousseau's Discourses was the first sign of reaction against the
historic mode of inquiry into society that had been initiated by
Montesquieu. The Spirit of Laws was published in 1748, with a truly
prodigious effect. It coloured the whole of the social literature
in France during the rest of the century. A history of its
influence would be a history of one of the most important sides of
speculative activity. In the social writings of Rousseau himself
there is hardly a chapter which does not contain tacit reference to
Montesquieu's book. The Discourses were the beginning of a movement
in an exactly opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.184" id="Page_i.184">[i.184]</a></span> direction; that is, away from patient
collection of wide multitudes of facts relating to the conditions
of society, towards the promulgation of arbitrary systems of
absolute social dogmas. Mably, the chief dogmatic socialist of the
century, and one of the most dignified and austere characters, is
an important example of the detriment done by the influence of
Rousseau to that of Montesquieu, in the earlier stages of the
conflict between the two schools. Mably (1709-1785), of whom the
remark is to be made that he was for some years behind the scenes
of government as De Tencin's secretary and therefore was versed in
affairs, began his inquiries with Greece and Rome. &quot;You will find
everything in ancient history,&quot; he said.<a name="FNanchor195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195">[195]</a> And he
remained entirely in this groove of thought until Rousseau
appeared. He then gradually left Montesquieu. &quot;To find the duties
of a legislator,&quot; he said, &quot;I descend into the abysses of my heart,
I study my sentiments.&quot; He opposed the Economists, the other school
that was feeling its way imperfectly enough to a positive method.
&quot;As soon as I see landed property established,&quot; he wrote, &quot;then I
see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.185" id="Page_i.185">[i.185]</a></span> unequal fortunes; and from these unequal fortunes must there
not necessarily result different and opposed interests, all the
vices of riches, all the vices of poverty, the brutalisation of
intelligence, the corruption of civil manners?&quot; and so
forth.<a name="FNanchor196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196">[196]</a>
In his most important work, published in 1776, we see Rousseau's
notions developed, with a logic from which their first author
shrunk, either from fear, or more probably from want of firmness
and consistency as a reasoner. &quot;It is to equality that nature has
attached the preservation of our social faculties and happiness:
and from this I conclude that legislation will only be taking
useless trouble, unless all its attention is first of all directed
to the establishment of equality in the fortune and condition of
citizens.&quot;<a name="FNanchor197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197">[197]</a> That is to say not only political
equality, but economic communism. &quot;What miserable folly, that
persons who pass for philosophers should go on repeating after one
another that without property there can be no society. Let us leave
illusion. It is property that divides us into two classes, rich and
poor; the first will alway prefer their fortune to that of the
state, while the second will never love a government or laws that
leave them in misery.&quot;<a name="FNanchor198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198">[198]</a> This was the kind of opinion for which
Rousseau's diffuse and rhetorical exposition of social necessity
had prepared France some twenty years before. After powerfully
helping the process of general dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.186" id="Page_i.186">[i.186]</a></span>solution, it produced the first
fruits specifically after its own kind some twenty years later in
the system of Baboeuf.<a name="FNanchor199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199">[199]</a></p>
<p>The unflinching application of principles is seldom achieved by
the men who first launch them. The labour of the preliminary task
seems to exhaust one man's stock of mental force. Rousseau never
thought of the subversion of society or its reorganisation on a
communistic basis. Within a few months of his profession of
profound lament that the first man who made a claim to property had
not been instantly unmasked as the arch foe of the race, he speaks
most respectfully of property as the pledge of the engagements of
citizens and the foundation of the social pact, while the first
condition of that pact is that every one should be maintained in
peaceful enjoyment of what belongs to him.<a name="FNanchor200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200">[200]</a> We need not
impute the apparent discrepancy to insincerity. Rousseau was always
apt to think in a slipshod manner. He sensibly though illogically
accepted wholesome practical maxims, as if they flowed from
theoretical premisses that were in truth utterly incompatible with
them.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_179"></a><a href="#FNanchor179">[179]</a> At
the end of the <i>Code de la Nature</i> Morelly places a complete
set of rules for the organisation of a model community. The base of
it was the absence of private property&#8212;a condition that was to be
preserved by vigilant education of the young in ways of thinking,
that should make the possession of private property odious or
inconceivable. There are to be sumptuary laws of a moderate kind.
The government is to be in the hands of the elders. The children
are to be taken away from their parents at the age of five; reared
and educated in public establishments; and returned to their
parents at the age of sixteen or so when they will marry. Marriage
is to be dissoluble at the end of ten years, but after divorce the
woman is not to marry a man younger than herself, nor is the man to
marry a woman younger than the wife from whom he has parted. The
children of a divorced couple are to remain with the father, and if
he marries again, they are to be held the children of the second
wife. Mothers are to suckle their own children (p. 220). The whole
scheme is fuller of good ideas than such schemes usually are.</p>

for instance is D'Alembert's story:&#8212;&quot;The necessity of shielding
our own body from pain and destruction leads us to examine among
external objects those which are useful and those which are
hurtful, so that we may seek the one and flee the others. But we
hardly begin our search into such objects before we discover among
them a great number of beings which strike us as exactly like
ourselves; that is, whose form is just like our own, and who, so
far as we can judge at the first glance, appear to have the same
perceptions. Everything therefore leads us to suppose that they
have also the same wants, and consequently the same interest in
satisfying them, whence it results that we must find great
advantage in joining with them for the purpose of distinguishing in
nature what has the power of preserving us from what has the power
of hurting us. The communication of ideas is the principle and the
stay of this union, and necessarily demands the invention of signs;
such is the origin of the formation of societies.&quot; <i>Discours
Pr&#233;liminaire de l'Encyclop&#233;die</i>. Contrast this
with Aristotle's sensible statement (<i>Polit.</i> I. ii. 15) that
&quot;there is in men by nature a strong impulse to enter into such
union.&quot;</p>

have lived with communities of savages in South America and in the
East, who have no laws or law courts but the public opinion of the
visage freely expressed. Each man scrupulously respects the rights
of his fellow, and any infraction of those rights rarely or never
takes place. In such a community all are nearly equal. There are
none of those wide distinctions of education and ignorance, wealth
and poverty, master and servant, which are the products of our
civilisation; there is none of that widespread division of labour
which, while it increases wealth, produces also conflicting
interests; there is not that severe competition and struggle for
existence, or for wealth, which the dense population of civilised
countries inevitably creates. All incitements to great crimes are
thus wanting, and petty ones are repressed, partly by the influence
of public opinion, but chiefly by that natural sense of justice and
of his neighbour's right, which seems to be in some degree inherent
in every race of man. Now, although we have progressed vastly
beyond the savage state in intellectual achievements, we have not
advanced equally in morals. It is true that among those classes who
have no wants that cannot be easily supplied, and among whom public
opinion has great influence, the rights of others are fully
respected. It is true, also, that we have vastly extended the
sphere of those rights, and include within them all the brotherhood
of man. But it is not too much to say, that the mass of our
populations have not at all advanced beyond the savage code of
morals, and have in many cases sunk below it.&quot; Wallace's <i>Malay

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI."></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>PARIS.</h3>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> what subtle process did Rousseau, whose ideal had been a
summer life among all the softnesses of sweet gardens and dappled
orchards, turn into panegyrist of the harsh austerity of old Cato
and grim Brutus's civic devotion? The amiability of eighteenth
century France&#8212;and France was amiable in spite of the atrocities
of White Penitents at Toulouse, and black Jansenists at Paris, and
the men and women who dealt in <i>lettres-de-cachet</i> at
Versailles&#8212;was revolted by the name of the cruel patriot who slew
his son for the honour of discipline.<a name="FNanchor201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201">[201]</a> How came
Rousseau of all men, the great humanitarian of his time, to rise to
the height of these unlovely rigours?</p>
<p>The answer is that he was a citizen of Geneva transplanted. He
had been bred in puritan and republican tradition, with love of God
and love of law and freedom and love of country all penetrating it,
and then he had been accidentally removed to a strange city that
was in active ferment with ideas that were the direct abnegation of
all these. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.188" id="Page_i.188">[i.188]</a></span> Paris the idea of a God was either repudiated along
with many other ancestral conceptions, or else it was fatally
entangled with the worst superstition and not seldom with the
vilest cruelties. The idea of freedom was unknown, and the idea of
law was benumbed by abuses and exceptions. The idea of country was
enfeebled in some and displaced in others by a growing passion for
the captivating something styled citizenship of the world. If
Rousseau could have ended his days among the tranquil lakes and
hills of Savoy, Geneva might possibly never have come back to him.
For it depends on circumstance, which of the chances that slumber
within us shall awake, and which shall fall unroused with us into
the darkness. The fact of Rousseau ranking among the greatest of
the writers of the French language, and the yet more important fact
that his ideas found their most ardent disciples and exploded in
their most violent form in France, constantly make us forget that
he was not a Frenchman, but a Genevese deeply imbued with the
spirit of his native city. He was thirty years old before he began
even temporarily to live in France: he had only lived there some
five or six years when he wrote his first famous piece, so
un-French in all its spirit; and the ideas of the Social Contract
were in germ before he settled in France at all.</p>
<p>There have been two great religious reactions, and the name of
Geneva has a fundamental association with each of them. The first
was that against the paganised Catholicism of the renaissance, and
of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.189" id="Page_i.189">[i.189]</a></span> Calvin was a prime leader; the second was that against the
materialism of the eighteenth century, of which the prime leader
was Rousseau. The diplomatist was right who called Geneva the fifth
part of the world. At the congress of Vienna, some one, wearied at
the enormous place taken by the hardly visible Geneva in the midst
of negotiations involving momentous issues for the whole habitable
globe, called out that it was after all no more than a grain of
sand. But he was not wrong who made bold to reply, &quot;Geneva is no
grain of sand; 'tis a grain of musk that perfumes all
Europe.&quot;<a name="FNanchor202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202">[202]</a>
We have to remember that it was at all events as a grain of musk
ever pervading the character of Rousseau. It happened in later
years that he repudiated his allegiance to her, but however
bitterly a man may quarrel with a parent, he cannot change blood,
and Rousseau ever remained a true son of the city of Calvin. We may
perhaps conjecture without excessive fancifulness that the constant
spectacle and memory of a community, free, energetic, and
prosperous, whose institutions had been shaped and whose political
temper had been inspired by one great lawgiver, contributed even
more powerfully than what he had picked up about Lycurgus and
Laced&#230;mon, to give him a turn for Utopian speculation, and a
conviction of the artificiality and easy modifiableness of the
social structure. This, however, is less certain than that he
unconsciously received impressions in his youth from the
circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.190" id="Page_i.190">[i.190]</a></span>stances of Geneva, both as to government and religion, as to
freedom, order, citizenship, manners, which formed the deepest part
of him on the reflective side, and which made themselves visible
whenever he exchanged the life of beatified sense for moods of
speculative energy, &quot;Never,&quot; he says, &quot;did I see the walls of that
happy city, I never went into it, without feeling a certain
faintness at my heart, due to excess of tender emotion. At the same
time that the noble image of freedom elevated my soul, those of
equality, of union, of gentle manners, touched me even to
tears.&quot;<a name="FNanchor203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203">[203]</a>
His spirit never ceased to haunt city and lake to the end, and he
only paid the debt of an owed acknowledgment in the dedication of
his Discourse on Inequality to the republic of Geneva.<a name="FNanchor204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204">[204]</a> It was there
it had its root. The honour in which industry was held in Geneva,
the democratic phrases that constituted the dialect of its
government, the proud tradition of the long battle which had won
and kept its independence, the severity of its manners, the
simplicity of its pleasures,&#8212;all these things awoke in his memory
as soon as ever occasion drew him to serious thought. More than
that, he had in a peculiar manner drawn in with the breath of his
earliest days in this theocratically constituted city, the vital
idea that there are sacred things and objects of reverence among
men. And hence there came to him, though with many stains and much
misdirection, the most priceless excellence of a capacity for
devout veneration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.191" id="Page_i.191">[i.191]</a></span></p>

<p>There is certainly no real contradiction between the quality of
reverence and the more equivocal quality of a sensuous temperament,
though a man may well seem on the surface, as the first succeeds
the second in rule over him, to be the contradiction to his other
self. The objects of veneration and the objects of sensuous delight
are externally so unlike and so incongruous, that he who follows
both in their turns is as one playing the part of an ironical
chorus in the tragi-comic drama of his own life. You may perceive
these two to be mere imperfect or illusory opposites, when you
confront a man like Rousseau with the true opposite of his own
type; with those who are from their birth analysts and critics,
keen, restless, urgent, inexorably questioning. That energetic
type, though not often dead or dull on the side of sense, yet is
incapable of steeping itself in the manifold delights of eye and
ear, of nostril and touch, with the peculiar intensity of passive
absorption that seeks nothing further nor deeper than unending
continuance of this profound repose of all filled sensation, just
as it is incapable of the kindred mood of elevated humility and
joyful unasking devoutness in the presence of emotions and dim
thoughts that are beyond the compass of words.</p>
<p>The citizen of Geneva with this unseen fibre of Calvinistic
veneration and austerity strong and vigorous within him, found a
world that had nothing sacred and took nothing for granted; that
held the past in contempt, and ever like old Athenians asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.192" id="Page_i.192">[i.192]</a></span> for
some new thing; that counted simplicity of life an antique
barbarism, and literary curiousness the master virtue. There were
giants in this world, like the panurgic Diderot. There were
industrious, worthy, disinterested men, who used their minds
honestly and actively with sincere care for truth, like D'Holbach.
There was poured around the whole, like a high stimulating
atmosphere to the stronger, and like some evil mental aphrodisiac
to the weaker, the influence of Voltaire, the great indomitable
chieftain of them all. Intellectual size half redeems want of
perfect direction by its generous power and fulness. It was not the
strong men, atheists and philosophisers as they were, who first
irritated Rousseau into revolt against their whole system of
thought in all its principles. The dissent between him and them was
fundamental and enormous, and in time it flamed out into open war.
Conflict of theory, however, was brought home to him first by
slow-growing exasperation at the follies in practice of the minor
disciples of the gospel of knowing and acting, as distinguished
from his own gospel of placid being. He craved beliefs that should
uphold men in living their lives, substantial helps on which they
might lean without examination and without mistrust: his life in
Paris was thrown among people who lived in the midst of open
questions, and revelled in a reflective and didactic morality,
which had no root in the heart and so made things easy for the
practical conscience. He sought tranquillity and valued life for
its own sake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.193" id="Page_i.193">[i.193]</a></span> not as an arena and a theme for endless argument and
debate: he found friends who knew no higher pleasure than the
futile polemics of mimic philosophy over dessert, who were as full
of quibble as the wrong-headed interlocutors in a Platonic
dialogue, and who babbled about God and state of nature, about
virtue and the spirituality of the soul, much as Boswell may have
done when Johnson complained of him for asking questions that would
make a man hang himself. The highest things were thus brought down
to the level of the cheapest discourse, and subjects which the wise
take care only to discuss with the wise, were here everyday topics
for all comers.</p>
<p>The association with such high themes of those light qualities
of tact, gaiety, complaisance, which are the life of the
superficial commerce of men and women of the world, probably gave
quite as much offence to Rousseau as the doctrines which some of
his companions had the honest courage or the heedless fatuity to
profess. It was an outrage to all the serious side of him to find
persons of quality introducing materialism as a new fashion, and
atheism as the liveliest of condiments. The perfume of good manners
only made what he took for bad principles the worse, and heightened
his impatience at the flippancy of pretensions to overthrow the
beliefs of a world between two wines.</p>
<p>Doctrine and temperament united to set him angrily against the
world around him. The one was austere and the other was sensuous,
and the sensuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.194" id="Page_i.194">[i.194]</a></span> temperament in its full strength is essentially
solitary. The play of social intercourse, its quick transitions,
and incessant demands, are fatal to free and uninterrupted
abandonment to the flow of soft internal emotions. Rousseau,
dreaming, moody, indolently, meditative, profoundly enwrapped in
the brooding egoism of his own sensations, had to mix with men and
women whose egoism took the contrary form of an eager desire to
produce flashing effects on other people. We may be sure that as
the two sides of his character&#8212;his notions of serious principle,
and his notions of personal comfort&#8212;both went in the same
direction, the irritation and impatience with which they inspired
him towards society did not lessen with increased communication,
but naturally deepened with a more profoundly settled
antipathy.</p>
<p>Rousseau lived in Paris for twelve years, from his return from
Venice in 1744 until his departure in 1756 for the rustic lodge in
a wood which the good-will of Madame d'Epinay provided for him. We
have already seen one very important side of his fortunes during
these years, in the relations he formed with Theresa, and the
relations which he repudiated with his children. We have heard too
the new words with which during these years he first began to make
the hearts of his contemporaries wax hot within them. It remains to
examine the current of daily circumstance on which his life was
embarked, and the shores to which it was bearing him.</p>
<p>His patrons were at present almost exclusively in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.195" id="Page_i.195">[i.195]</a></span> the circle of
finance. Richelieu, indeed, took him for a moment by the hand, but
even the introduction to him was through the too frail wife of one
of the greatest of the farmers general.<a name="FNanchor205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205">[205]</a> Madame Dupin
and Madame d'Epinay, his two chief patronesses, were also both of
them the wives of magnates of the farm. The society of the great
people of this world was marked by all the glare, artificiality,
and sentimentalism of the epoch, but it had also one or two
specially hollow characteristics of its own. As is always the case
when a new rich class rises in the midst of a community possessing
an old caste, the circle of Parisian financiers made it their
highest social aim to thrust and strain into the circle of the
Versailles people of quality. They had no normal life of their own,
with independent traditions and self-respect; and for the same
reason that an essentially worn-out aristocracy may so long
preserve a considerable degree of vigour and even of social utility
under certain circumstances by means of tenacious pride in its own
order, a new plutocracy is demoralised from the very beginning of
its existence by want of a similar kind of pride in itself, and by
the ignoble necessity of craving the countenance of an upper class
that loves to despise and humiliate it. Besides the more obvious
evils of a position resting entirely on material opulence, and
maintaining itself by coarse and glittering osten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.196" id="Page_i.196">[i.196]</a></span>tation, there is a
fatal moral hollowness which infects both serious conduct and
social diversion. The result is seen in imitative manners, affected
culture, and a mixture of timorous self-consciousness within and
noisy self-assertion without, which completes the most distasteful
scene that any collected spirit can witness.</p>
<p>Rousseau was, as has been said, the secretary of Madame Dupin
and her stepson Francueil. He occasionally went with them to
Chenonceaux in Touraine, one of Henry the Second's castles built
for Diana of Poitiers, and here he fared sumptuously every day. In
Paris his means, as we know, were too strait. For the first two
years he had a salary of nine hundred francs; then his employers
raised it to as much as fifty louis. For the first of the
Discourses the publisher gave him nothing, and for the second he
had to extract his fee penny by penny, and after long waiting. His
comic opera, the Village Soothsayer, was a greater success; it
brought him the round sum of two hundred louis from the court, and
some five and twenty more from the bookseller, and so, he says,
&quot;the interlude, which cost me five or six weeks of work, produced
nearly as much money as Emilius afterwards did, which had cost me
twenty years of meditation and three years of composition.&quot;<a name="FNanchor206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206">[206]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.197" id="Page_i.197">[i.197]</a></span> Before the
arrival of this windfall, M. Francueil, who was receiver-general,
offered him the post of cashier in that important department, and
Rousseau attended for some weeks to receive the necessary
instructions. His progress was tardy as usual, and the complexities
of accounts were as little congenial to him as notarial
complexities had been three and twenty years previously. It is,
however, one of the characteristics of times of national break-up
not to be peremptory in exacting competence, and Rousseau gravely
sat at the receipt of custom, doing the day's duty with as little
skill as liking. Before he had been long at his post, his official
chief going on a short journey left him in charge of the chest,
which happened at the moment to contain no very portentous amount.
The disquiet with which the watchful custody of this moderate
treasure harassed and afflicted Rousseau, not only persuaded him
that nature had never designed him to be the guardian of money
chests, but also threw him into a fit of very painful illness. The
surgeons let him understand that within six months he would be in
the pale kingdoms. The effect of such a hint on a man of his
temper, and the train of reflections which it would be sure to set
aflame, are to be foreseen by us who know Rousseau's fashion of
dealing with the irksome. Why sacrifice the peace and charm of the
little fragment of days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.198" id="Page_i.198">[i.198]</a></span> left to him, to the bondage of an office
for which he felt nothing but disgust? How reconcile the austere
principles which he had just adopted in his denunciation of
sciences and arts, and his panegyric on the simplicity of the
natural life, with such duties as he had to perform? And how preach
disinterestedness and frugality from amid the cashboxes of a
receiver-general? Plainly it was his duty to pass in independence
and poverty the little time that was yet left to him, to bring all
the forces of his soul to bear in breaking the fetters of opinion,
and to carry out courageously whatever seemed best to himself,
without suffering the judgment of others to interpose the slightest
embarrassment or hindrance.<a name="FNanchor207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207">[207]</a></p>
<p>With Rousseau, to conceive a project of this kind for
simplifying his life was to hasten urgently towards its
realisation, because such projects harmonised with all his
strongest predispositions. His design mastered and took whole
possession of him. He resolved to earn his living by copying music,
as that was conformable to his taste, within his capacity, and
compatible with entire personal freedom. His patron did as the
world is so naturally ready to do with those who choose the stoic's
way; he declared that Rousseau was gone mad.<a name="FNanchor208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208">[208]</a> Talk like this
had no effect on a man whom self-indulgence led into a path that
others would only have been forced into by self-denial. Let it be
said, however, that this is a form of self-indulgence of which
society is never likely to see an excess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.199" id="Page_i.199">[i.199]</a></span> and meanwhile we may
continue to pay it some respect as assuredly leaning to virtue's
side. Rousseau's many lapses from grace perhaps deserve a certain
gentleness of treatment, after the time when with deliberation and
collected effort he set himself to the hard task of fitting his
private life to his public principles. Anything that heightens the
self-respect of the race is good for us to behold, and it is a
permanent source of comfort to all who thirst after reality in
teachers, whether their teaching happens to be our own or not, to
find that the prophet of social equality was not a fine gentleman,
nor the teacher of democracy a hanger-on to the silly skirts of
fashion.</p>
<p>Rousseau did not merely throw up a post which would one day have
made him rich. Stoicism on the heroic, peremptory scale is not so
difficult as the application of the same principle to trifles.
Besides this greater sacrifice, he gave up the pleasant things for
which most men value the money that procures them, and instituted
an austere sumptuary reform in truly Genevese spirit. His sword was
laid aside; for flowing peruke was substituted the small round wig;
he left off gilt buttons and white stockings, and he sold his watch
with the joyful and singular thought that he would never again need
to know the time. One sacrifice remained to be made. Part of his
equipment for the Venetian embassy had been a large stock of fine
linen, and for this he retained a particular affection, for both
now and always Rousseau had a passion for personal cleanliness, as
he had for cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.200" id="Page_i.200">[i.200]</a></span>poreal wholesomeness. He was seasonably delivered
from bondage to his fine linen by aid from without. One Christmas
Eve it lay drying in a garret in the rather considerable quantity
of forty-two shirts, when a thief, always suspected to be the
brother of Theresa, broke open the door and carried off the
treasure, leaving Rousseau henceforth to be the contented wearer of
coarser stuffs.<a name="FNanchor209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209">[209]</a></p>
<p>We may place this reform towards the end of the year 1750, or
the beginning of 1751, when his mind was agitated by the busy
discussion which his first Discourse excited, and by the new ideas
of literary power which its reception by the public naturally
awakened in him. &quot;It takes,&quot; wrote Diderot, &quot;right above the
clouds; never was such a success.&quot;<a name="FNanchor210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210">[210]</a> We can hardly have a surer sign of a
man's fundamental sincerity than that his first triumph, the first
revelation to him of his power, instead of seducing him to frequent
the mischievous and disturbing circle of his applauders, should
throw him inwards upon himself and his own principles with new
earnestness and refreshed independence. Rousseau very soon made up
his mind what the world was worth to him; and this, not as the
ordinary sentimentalist or satirist does, by way of set-off against
the indulgence of personal foibles, but from recognition of his own
qualities, of the bounds set to our capacity of life, and of the
limits of the world's power to satisfy us. &quot;When my destiny threw
me into the whirlpool of society,&quot; he wrote in his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.201" id="Page_i.201">[i.201]</a></span> meditation
on the course of his own life, &quot;I found nothing there to give a
moment's solace to my heart. Regret for my sweet leisure followed
me everywhere; it shed indifference or disgust over all that might
have been within my reach, leading to fortune and honours.
Uncertain in the disquiet of my desires, I hoped for little, I
obtained less, and I felt even amid gleams of prosperity that if I
obtained all that I supposed myself to be seeking, I should still
not have found the happiness for which my heart was greedily
athirst, though without distinctly knowing its object. Thus
everything served to detach my affections from society, even before
the misfortunes which were to make me wholly a stranger to it. I
reached the age of forty, floating between indigence and fortune,
between wisdom and disorder, full of vices of habit without any
evil tendency at heart, living by hazard, distracted as to my
duties without despising them, but often without much clear
knowledge what they were.&quot;<a name="FNanchor211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211">[211]</a></p>
<p>A brooding nature gives to character a connectedness and unity
that is in strong contrast with the dispersion and multiformity of
the active type. The attractions of fame never cheated Rousseau
into forgetfulness of the commanding principle that a man's life
ought to be steadily composed to oneness with itself in all its
parts, as by mastery of an art of moral counterpoint, and not
crowded with a wild mixture of aim and emotion like distracted
masks in high carnival. He complains of the philosophers with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.202" id="Page_i.202">[i.202]</a></span> whom
he came into contact, that their philosophy was something foreign
to them and outside of their own lives. They studied human nature
for the sake of talking learnedly about it, not for the sake of
self-knowledge; they laboured to instruct others, not to enlighten
themselves within. When they published a book, its contents only
interested them to the extent of making the world accept it,
without seriously troubling themselves whether it were true or
false, provided only that it was not refuted. &quot;For my own part,
when I desired to learn, it was to know things myself, and not at
all to teach others. I always believed that before instructing
others it was proper to begin by knowing enough for one's self; and
of all the studies that I have tried to follow in my life in the
midst of men, there is hardly one that I should not have followed
equally if I had been alone, and shut up in a desert island for the
rest of my days.&quot;<a name="FNanchor212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212">[212]</a></p>
<p>When we think of Turgot, whom Rousseau occasionally met among
the society which he denounces, such a denunciation sounds a little
outrageous. But then Turgot was perhaps the one sane Frenchman of
the first eminence in the eighteenth century. Voltaire chose to be
an exile from the society of Paris and Versailles as pertinaciously
as Rousseau did, and he spoke more bitterly of it in verse than
Rousseau ever spoke bitterly of it in prose.<a name="FNanchor213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213">[213]</a> It was, as has
been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.203" id="Page_i.203">[i.203]</a></span> often said, a society dominated by women, from the king's
mistress who helped to ruin France, down to the financier's wife
who gave suppers to flashy men of letters. The eighteenth century
salon has been described as having three stages; the salon of 1730,
still retaining some of the stately domesticity, elegance, dignity
of the age of Lewis XIV.; that of 1780, grave, cold, dry, given to
dissertation; and between the two, the salon of 1750, full of
intellectual stir, brilliance, frivolous originality, glittering
wastefulness.<a name="FNanchor214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214">[214]</a> Though this division of time must not be
pressed too closely, it is certain that the era of Rousseau's
advent in literature with his Discourses fell in with the climax of
social unreality in the surface intercourse of France, and that the
same date marks the highest point of feminine activity and
power.</p>
<p>The common mixture of much reflective morality in theory with
much light-hearted immorality in practice, never entered so largely
into manners. We have constantly to wonder how they analysed and
defined the word Virtue, to which they so constantly appealed in
letters, conversation, and books, as the sovereign object for our
deepest and warmest adoration. A whole company of transgressors of
the marriage law would melt into floods of tears over a hymn to
virtue, which they must surely have held of too sacred an essence
to mix itself with any one virtue in particular, except that very
considerable one of charitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.204" id="Page_i.204">[i.204]</a></span> letting all do as they please. It is
much, however, that these tears, if not very burning, were really
honest. Society, though not believing very deeply in the
supernatural, was not cursed with an arid, parching, and hardened
scepticism about the genuineness of good emotions in a man, and so
long as people keep this baleful poison out of their hearts, their
lives remain worth having.</p>
<p>It is true that cynicism in the case of some women of this time
occasionally sounded in a diabolic key, as when one said, &quot;It is
your lover to whom you should never say that you don't believe in
God; to one's husband that does not matter, because in the case of
a lover one must reserve for one's self some door of escape, and
devotional scruples cut everything short.&quot;<a name="FNanchor215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215">[215]</a> Or here: &quot;I
do not distrust anybody, for that is a deliberate act; but I do not
trust anybody, and there is no trouble in this.&quot;<a name="FNanchor216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216">[216]</a> Or again in
the word thrown to a man vaunting the probity of some one: &quot;What!
can a man of intelligence like you accept the prejudice of
<i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>?&quot;<a name="FNanchor217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217">[217]</a>  Such speech, however, was probably most
often a mere freak of the tongue, a mode and fashion, as who should
go to a masked ball in guise of Mephistopheles, without anything
more Mephistophelian about him than red apparel and peaked toes.
&quot;She was absolutely charming,&quot; said one of a new-comer; &quot;she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.205" id="Page_i.205">[i.205]</a></span>
not utter one single word that was not a paradox.&quot;<a name="FNanchor218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218">[218]</a> This was the
passing taste. Human nature is able to keep itself wholesome in
fundamentals even under very great difficulties, and it is as wise
as it is charitable in judging a sharp and cynical tone to make
large allowances for mere costume and assumed character.</p>
<p>In respect of the light companionship of common usage, however,
it is exactly the costume which comes closest to us, and bad taste
in that is most jarring and least easily forgiven. There is a
certain stage in an observant person's experience of the
heedlessness, indolence, and native folly of men and women&#8212;and if
his observation be conducted in a catholic spirit, he will probably
see something of this not merely in others&#8212;when the tolerable
average sanity of human arrangements strikes him as the most
marvellous of all the fortunate accidents in the universe. Rousseau
could not even accept the fact of this miraculous result, the
provisional and temporary sanity of things, and he confronted
society with eyes of angry chagrin. A great lady asked him how it
was that she had not seen him for an age. &quot;Because when I wish to
see you, I wish to see no one but you. What do you want me to do in
the midst of your society? I should cut a sorry figure in a circle
of mincing tripping coxcombs; they do not suit me.&quot; We cannot
wonder that on some occasion when her son's proficiency was to be
tested before a company of friends, Madame d'Epinay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.206" id="Page_i.206">[i.206]</a></span> prayed Rousseau
to be of them, on the ground that he would be sure to ask the child
outrageously absurd questions, which would give gaiety to the
affair.<a name="FNanchor219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219">[219]</a>
As it happened, the father was unwise. He was a man of whom it was
said that he had devoured two million francs, without either saying
or doing a single good thing. He rewarded the child's performance
with the gift of a superb suit of cherry-coloured velvet,
extravagantly trimmed with costly lace; the peasant from whose
sweat and travail the money had been wrung, went in heavy rags, and
his children lived as the beasts of the field. The poor youth was
ill dealt with. &quot;That is very fine,&quot; said rude Duclos, &quot;but
remember that a fool in lace is still a fool.&quot; Rousseau, in reply
to the child's importunity, was still blunter: &quot;Sir, I am no judge
of finery, I am only a judge of man; I wished to talk with you a
little while ago, but I wish so no longer.&quot;<a name="FNanchor220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220">[220]</a></p>
<p>Marmontel, whose account may have been coloured by retrospection
in later years, says that before the success of the first
Discourse, Rousseau concealed his pride under the external forms of
a politeness that was timid even to obsequiousness; in his uneasy
glance you perceived mistrust and observant jealousy; there was no
freedom in his manner, and no one ever observed more cautiously the
hateful precept to live with your friends as though they were one
day to be your enemies.<a name="FNanchor221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221">[221]</a> Grimm's description is different and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.207" id="Page_i.207">[i.207]</a></span>
more trustworthy. Until he began to affect singularity, he says,
Rousseau had been gallant and overflowing with artificial
compliment, with manners that were honeyed and even wearisome in
their soft elaborateness. All at once he put on the cynic's cloak,
and went to the other extreme. Still in spite of an abrupt and
cynical tone he kept much of his old art of elaborate fine
speeches, and particularly in his relations with women.<a name="FNanchor222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222">[222]</a> Of his
abruptness, he tells a most displeasing tale. &quot;One day Rousseau
told us with an air of triumph, that as he was coming out of the
opera where he had been seeing the first representation of the
Village Soothsayer, the Duke of Zweibr&#252;cken had approached him
with much politeness, saying, 'Will you allow me to pay you a
compliment?' and that he replied, 'Yes, if it be very short.'
Everybody was silent at this, until I said to him laughingly,
'Illustrious citizen and co-sovereign of Geneva, since there
resides in you a part of the sovereignty of the republic, let me
represent to you that, for all the severity of your principles, you
should hardly refuse to a sovereign prince the respect due to a
water-carrier, and that if you had met a word of good-will from a
water-carrier with an answer as rough and brutal as that, you would
have had to reproach yourself with a most unseasonable piece of
impertinence.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223">[223]</a></p>
<p>There were still more serious circumstances when exasperation at
the flippant tone about him carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.208" id="Page_i.208">[i.208]</a></span> him beyond the ordinary bounds
of that polite time. A guest at table asked contemptuously what was
the use of a nation like the French having reason, if they did not
use it. &quot;They mock the other nations of the earth, and yet are the
most credulous of all.&quot; ROUSSEAU: &quot;I forgive them for their
credulity, but not for condemning those who are credulous in some
other way.&quot; Some one said that in matters of religion everybody was
right, but that everybody should remain in that in which he had
been born. ROUSSEAU, with warmth: &quot;Not so, by God, if it is a bad
one, for then it can do nothing but harm.&quot; Then some one contended
that religion always did some good, as a kind of rein to the common
people who had no other morality. All the rest cried out at this in
indignant remonstrance, one shrewd person remarking that the common
people had much livelier fear of being hanged than of being damned.
The conversation was broken off for a moment by the hostess calling
out, &quot;After all, one must nourish the tattered affair we call our
body, so ring and let them bring us the joint.&quot; This done, the
servants dismissed, and the door shut, the discussion was resumed
with such vehemence by Duclos and Saint Lambert, that, says the
lady who tells us the story, &quot;I feared they were bent on destroying
all religion, and I prayed for some mercy to be shown at any rate
to natural religion.&quot; There was not a whit more sympathy for that
than for the rest. Rousseau declared himself <i>paullo
infirmior</i>, and clung to the morality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.209" id="Page_i.209">[i.209]</a></span> gospel as the
natural morality which in old times constituted the whole and only
creed. &quot;But what is a God,&quot; cried one impetuous disputant, &quot;who
gets angry and is appeased again?&quot; Rousseau began to murmur between
grinding teeth, and a tide of pleasantries set in at his expense,
to which came this: &quot;If it is a piece of cowardice to suffer ill to
be spoken of one's friend behind his back, 'tis a crime to suffer
ill to be spoken of one's God, who is present; and for my part,
sirs, I believe in God.&quot; &quot;I admit,&quot; said the atheistic champion,
&quot;that it is a fine thing to see this God bending his brow to earth
and watching with admiration the conduct of a Cato. But this notion
is, like many others, very useful in some great heads, such as
Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Socrates, where it can only produce
heroism, but it is the germ of all madnesses.&quot; ROUSSEAU: &quot;Sirs, I
leave the room if you say another word more,&quot; and he was rising to
fulfil his threat, when the entry of a new-comer stopped the
discussion.<a name="FNanchor224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224">[224]</a></p>
<p>His words on another occasion show how all that he saw helped to
keep up a fretted condition of mind, in one whose soft tenacious
memory turned daily back to simple and unsophisticated days among
the green valleys, and refused to acquiesce in the conditions of
changed climate. So terrible a thing is it to be the bondsman of
reminiscence. Madame d'Epinay was suspected, wrongfully as it
afterwards proved, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.210" id="Page_i.210">[i.210]</a></span> having destroyed some valuable papers
belonging to a dead relative. There was much idle and cruel gossip
in an ill-natured world. Rousseau, her friend, kept steadfast
silence: she challenged his opinion. &quot;What am I to say?&quot; he
answered; &quot;I go and come, and all that I hear outrages and revolts
me. I see the one so evidently malicious and so adroit in their
injustice; the other so awkward and so stupid in their good
intentions, that I am tempted (and it is not the first time) to
look on Paris as a cavern of brigands, of whom every traveller in
his turn is the victim. What gives me the worst idea of society is
to see how eager each person is to pardon himself, by reason of the
number of the people who are like him.&quot;<a name="FNanchor225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225">[225]</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding his hatred of this cavern of brigands, and the
little pains he took to conceal his feelings from any individual
brigand, whether male or female, with whom he had to deal, he found
out that &quot;it is not always so easy as people suppose to be poor and
independent.&quot; Merciless invasion of his time in every shape made
his life weariness. Sometimes he had the courage to turn and rend
the invader, as in the letter to a painter who sent him the same
copy of verses three times, requiring immediate acknowledgment. &quot;It
is not just,&quot; at length wrote the exasperated Rousseau, &quot;that I
should be tyrannised over for your pleasure; not that my time is
precious, as you say; it is either passed in suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.211" id="Page_i.211">[i.211]</a></span> or it is
lost in idleness; but when I cannot employ it usefully for some
one, I do not wish to be hindered from wasting it in my own
fashion. A single minute thus usurped is what all the kings of the
universe could not give me back, and it is to be my own master that
I flee from the idle folk of towns,&#8212;people as thoroughly wearied
as they are thoroughly wearisome,&#8212;who, because they do not know
what to do with their own time, think they have a right to waste
that of others.&quot;<a name="FNanchor226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226">[226]</a> The more abruptly he treated visitors,
persecuting dinner-givers, and all the tribe of the importunate,
the more obstinate they were in possessing themselves of his time.
In seizing the hours they were keeping his purse empty, as well as
keeping up constant irritation in his soul. He appears to have
earned forty sous for a morning's work, and to have counted this a
fair fee, remarking modestly that he could not well subsist on
less.<a name="FNanchor227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227">[227]</a> He
had one chance of a pension, which he threw from him in a truly
characteristic manner.</p>
<p>When he came to Paris he composed his musical diversion of the
Muses Galantes, which was performed (1745) in the presence of
Rameau, under the patronage of M. de la Popelini&#232;re. Rameau
apostrophised the unlucky composer with much violence, declaring
that one-half of the piece was the work of a master, while the
other was that of a person entirely ignorant of the musical
rudiments; the bad work therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.212" id="Page_i.212">[i.212]</a></span> was Rousseau's own, and the good
was a plagiarism.<a name="FNanchor228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228">[228]</a> This repulse did not daunt the hero.
Five or six years afterwards on a visit to Passy, as he was lying
awake in bed, he conceived the idea of a pastoral interlude after
the manner of the Italian comic operas. In six days the Village
Soothsayer was sketched, and in three weeks virtually completed.
Duclos procured its rehearsal at the Opera, and after some debate
it was performed before the court at Fontainebleau. The Plutarchian
stoic, its author, went from Paris in a court coach, but his Roman
tone deserted him, and he felt shamefaced as a schoolboy before the
great world, such divinity doth hedge even a Lewis XV., and even in
a soul of Genevan temper. The piece was played with great success,
and the composer was informed that he would the next day have the
honour of being presented to the king, who would most probably mark
his favour by the bestowal of a pension.<a name="FNanchor229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229">[229]</a> Rousseau was
tossed with many doubts. He would fain have greeted the king with
some word that should show sensibility to the royal graciousness,
without compromising republican severity, &quot;clothing some great and
useful truth in a fine and deserved compliment.&quot; This moral
difficulty was heightened by a physical one, for he was liable to
an infirmity which, if it should overtake him in presence of king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.213" id="Page_i.213">[i.213]</a></span>
and courtiers, would land him in an embarrassment worse than death.
What would become of him if mind or body should fail, if either he
should be driven into precipitate retreat, or else there should
escape him, instead of the great truth wrapped delicately round in
veracious panegyric, a heavy, shapeless word of foolishness? He
fled in terror, and flung up the chance of pension and patronage.
We perceive the born dreamer with a phantasmagoric imagination,
seizing nothing in just proportion and true relation, and
paralysing the spirit with terror of unrealities; in short, with
the most fatal form of moral cowardice, which perhaps it is a
little dangerous to try to analyse into finer names.</p>
<p>When Rousseau got back to Paris he was amazed to find that
Diderot spoke to him of this abandonment of the pension with a fire
that he could never have expected from a philosopher, Rousseau
plainly sharing the opinion of more vulgar souls that philosopher
is but fool writ large. &quot;He said that if I was disinterested on my
own account, I had no right to be so on that of Madame Le Vasseur
and her daughter, and that I owed it to them not to let pass any
possible and honest means of giving them bread.... This was the
first real dispute I had with him, and all our quarrels that
followed were of the same kind; he laying down for me what he
insisted that I should do, and I refusing because I thought that I
ought not to do it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230">[230]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.214" id="Page_i.214">[i.214]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us abstain, at this and all other points, from being too
sure that we easily see to the bottom of our Rousseau. When we are
most ready to fling up the book and to pronounce him all
selfishness and sophistry, some trait is at hand to revive moral
interest in him, and show him unlike common men, reverent of truth
and human dignity. There is a slight anecdote of this kind
connected with his visit to Fontainebleau. The day after the
representation of his piece, he happened to be taking his breakfast
in some public place. An officer entered, and, proceeding to
describe the performance of the previous day, told at great length
all that had happened, depicted the composer with much minuteness,
and gave a circumstantial account of his conversation. In this
story, which was told with equal assurance and simplicity, there
was not a word of truth, as was clear from the fact that the author
of whom he spoke with such intimacy sat unknown and unrecognised
before his eyes. The effect on Rousseau was singular enough. &quot;The
man was of a certain age; he had no coxcombical or swaggering air;
his expression bespoke a man of merit, and his cross of St. Lewis
showed that he was an old officer. While he was retailing his
untruths, I grew red in the face, I lowered my eyes, I sat on
thorns; I tried to think of some means of believing him to have
made a mistake in good faith. At length trembling lest some one
should recognise me and confront him, I hastened to finish my
chocolate without saying a word; and stooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.215" id="Page_i.215">[i.215]</a></span> down as I passed in
front of him, I went out as fast as possible, while the people
present discussed his tale. I perceived in the street that I was
bathed in sweat, and I am sure that if any one had recognised me
and called me by name before I got out, they would have seen in me
the shame and embarrassment of a culprit, simply from a feeling of
the pain the poor man would have had to suffer if his lie had been
discovered.&quot;<a name="FNanchor231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231">[231]</a> One who can feel thus vividly
humiliated by the meanness of another, assuredly has in himself the
wholesome salt of respect for the erectness of his fellows; he has
the rare sentiment that the compromise of integrity in one of them
is as a stain on his own self-esteem, and a lowering of his own
moral stature. There is more deep love of humanity in this than in
giving many alms, and it was not the less deep for being the
product of impulse and sympathetic emotion, and not of a logical
sorites.</p>
<p>Another scene in a caf&#233; is worth referring to, because it
shows in the same way that at this time Rousseau's egoism fell
short of the fatuousness to which disease or vicious habit
eventually depraved it. In 1752 he procured the representation of
his comedy of Narcisse, which he had written at the age of
eighteen, and which is as well worth reading or playing as most
comedies by youths of that amount of experience of the ways of the
world and the heart of man. Rousseau was amazed and touched by the
indulgence of the public, in suffering without any sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.216" id="Page_i.216">[i.216]</a></span> of
impatience even a second representation of his piece. For himself,
he could not so much as sit out the first; quitting the theatre
before it was over, he entered the famous caf&#233; de Procope at
the other side of the street, where he found critics as wearied as
himself. Here he called out, &quot;The new piece has fallen flat, and it
deserved to fall flat; it wearied me to death. It is by Rousseau of
Geneva, and I am that very Rousseau.&quot;<a name="FNanchor232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232">[232]</a> The
relentless student of mental pathology is very likely to insist
that even this was egoism standing on its head and not on its feet,
choosing to be noticed for an absurdity, rather than not be noticed
at all. It may be so, but this inversion of the ordinary form of
vanity is rare enough to be not unrefreshing, and we are very loth
to hand Rousseau wholly over to the pathologist before his hour has
come.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>In the summer of 1754 Rousseau, in company with his Theresa,
went to revisit the city of his birth, partly because an
exceptionally favourable occasion presented itself, but in yet
greater part because he was growing increasingly weary of the
uncongenial world in which he moved. On his road he turned aside to
visit her who had been more than even his birth-place to him. He
felt the shock known to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.217" id="Page_i.217">[i.217]</a></span> who cherish a vision for a dozen years,
and then suddenly front the changed reality. He had not prepared
himself by recalling the commonplace which we only remember for
others, how time wears hard and ugly lines into the face that
recollection at each new energy makes lovelier with an added
sweetness. &quot;I saw her,&quot; he says, &quot;but in what a state, O God, in
what debasement! Was this the same Madame de Warens, in those days
so brilliant, to whom the priest of Pontverre had sent me! How my
heart was torn by the sight!&quot; Alas, as has been said with a truth
that daily experience proves to those whom pity and self-knowledge
have made most indulgent, as to those whom pinched maxims have made
most rigorous,&#8212;<i>morality is the nature of things</i>.<a name="FNanchor233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233">[233]</a> We may have a
humane tenderness for our Manon Lescaut, but we have a deep
presentiment all the time that the poor soul must die in a penal
settlement. It is partly a question of time; whether death comes
fast enough to sweep you out of reach of the penalties which the
nature of things may appoint, but which in their fiercest shape are
mostly of the loitering kind. Death was unkind to Madame de Warens,
and the unhappy creature lived long enough to find that morality
does mean something after all; that the old hoary world has not
fixed on prudence in the outlay of money as a good thing, out of
avarice or pedantic dryness of heart; nor on some continence and
order in the relations of men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.218" id="Page_i.218">[i.218]</a></span> women as a good thing, out of
cheerless grudge to the body, but because the breach of such
virtues is ever in the long run deadly to mutual trust, to
strength, to freedom, to collectedness, which are the reserve of
humanity against days of ordeal.</p>
<p>Rousseau says that he tried hard to prevail upon his fallen
benefactress to leave Savoy, to come and take up her abode
peacefully with him, while he and Theresa would devote their days
to making her happy. He had not forgotten her in the little glimpse
of prosperity; he had sent her money when he had it.<a name="FNanchor234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234">[234]</a> She was sunk
in indigence, for her pension had long been forestalled, but still
she refused to change her home. While Rousseau was at Geneva she
came to see him. &quot;She lacked money to complete her journey; I had
not enough about me; I sent it to her an hour afterwards by
Theresa. Poor Maman! Let me relate this trait of her heart. The
only trinket she had left was a small ring; she took it from her
finger to place it on Theresa's, who instantly put it back, as she
kissed the noble hand and bathed it with her tears.&quot; In after years
he poured bitter reproaches upon himself for not quitting all to
attach his lot to hers until her last hour, and he professes always
to have been haunted by the liveliest and most enduring
remorse.<a name="FNanchor235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235">[235]</a>
Here is the worst of measuring duty by sensation instead of
principle; if the sensations happen not to be in right order at the
critical moment, the chance goes by, never to return, and then, as
memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.219" id="Page_i.219">[i.219]</a></span> in the best of such temperaments is long though not without
intermittence, old sentiment revives and drags the man into a
burning pit. Rousseau appears not to have seen her again, but the
thought of her remained with him to the end, like a soft vesture
fragrant with something of the sweet mysterious perfume of
many-scented night in the silent garden at Charmettes. She died in
a hovel eight years after this, sunk in disease, misery, and
neglect, and was put away in the cemetery on the heights above
Chamb&#233;ri.<a name="FNanchor236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236">[236]</a> Rousseau consoled himself with thoughts
of another world that should reunite him to her and be the dawn of
new happiness; like a man who should illusorily confound the last
glistening of a wintry sunset seen through dark yew-branches, with
the broad-beaming strength of the summer morning. &quot;If I thought,&quot;
he said, &quot;that I should not see her in the other life, my poor
imagination would shrink from the idea of perfect bliss, which I
would fain promise myself in it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237">[237]</a> To pluck so gracious a flower of hope
on the edge of the sombre unechoing gulf of nothingness into which
our friend has slid silently down, is a natural impulse of the
sensitive soul, numbing remorse and giving a moment's relief to the
hunger and thirst of a tenderness that has been robbed of its
object. Yet would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.220" id="Page_i.220">[i.220]</a></span> not men be more likely to have a deeper love for
those about them, and a keener dread of filling a house with aching
hearts, if they courageously realised from the beginning of their
days that we have none of this perfect companionable bliss to
promise ourselves in other worlds, that the black and horrible
grave is indeed the end of our communion, and that we know one
another no more?</p>
<p>The first interview between Rousseau and Madame de Warens was
followed by his ludicrous conversion to Catholicism (1728); the
last was contemporary with his re-conversion to the faith in which
he had been reared. The sight of Geneva gave new fire to his
Republican enthusiasm; he surrendered himself to transports of
patriotic zeal. The thought of the Parisian world that he had left
behind, its frivolity, its petulance, its disputation over all
things in heaven and on the earth, its profound deadness to all
civic activity, quickened his admiration for the simple,
industrious, and independent community from which he never forgot
that he was sprung. But no Catholic could enjoy the rights of
citizenship. So Rousseau proceeded to reflect that the Gospel is
the same for all Christians, and the substance of dogma only
differs, because people interposed with explanations of what they
could not understand; that therefore it is in each country the
business of the sovereign to fix both the worship and the amount
and quality of unintelligible dogma; that consequently it is the
citizen's duty to admit the dogma, and follow the worship by law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.221" id="Page_i.221">[i.221]</a></span>
appointed. &quot;The society of the Encyclop&#230;dists, far from
shaking my faith, had confirmed it by my natural aversion for
partisanship and controversy. The reading of the Bible, especially
of the Gospel, to which I had applied myself for several years, had
made me despise the low and childish interpretation put upon the
words of Christ by the people who were least worthy to understand
him. In a word, philosophy by drawing me towards the essential in
religion, had drawn me away from that stupid mass of trivial
formulas with which men had overlaid and darkened it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238">[238]</a> We may be
sure that if Rousseau had a strong inclination towards a given
course of action, he would have no difficulty in putting his case
in a blaze of the brightest light, and surrounding it with endless
emblems and devices of superlative conviction. In short, he
submitted himself faithfully to the instruction of the pastor of
his parish; was closely catechised by a commission of members of
the consistory; received from them a certificate that he had
satisfied the requirements of doctrine in all points; was received
to partake of the Communion, and finally restored to all his rights
as a citizen.<a name="FNanchor239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239">[239]</a></p>
<p>This was no farce, such as Voltaire played now and again at the
expense of an unhappy bishop or unhappier parish priest; nor such
as Rousseau himself had played six-and-twenty years before, at the
expense of those honest Catholics of Turin whose helpful dona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.222" id="Page_i.222">[i.222]</a></span>tion
of twenty francs had marked their enthusiasm over a soul that had
been lost and was found again. He was never a Catholic, any more
than he was ever an atheist, and if it might be said in one sense
that he was no more a Protestant than he was either of these two,
yet he was emphatically the child of Protestantism. It is hardly
too much to say that one bred in Catholic tradition and observance,
accustomed to think of the whole life of men as only a
manifestation of the unbroken life of the Church, and of all the
several communities of men as members of that great organisation
which binds one order to another, and each generation to those that
have gone before and those that come after, would never have
dreamed that monstrous dream of a state of nature as a state of
perfection. He would never have held up to ridicule and hate the
idea of society as an organism with normal parts and conditions of
growth, and never have left the spirit of man standing in bald
isolation from history, from his fellows, from a Church, from a
mediator, face to face with the great vague phantasm. Nor, on the
other hand, is it likely that one born and reared in the religious
school of authority with its elaborately disciplined hierarchy,
would have conceived that passion for political freedom, that zeal
for the rights of peoples against rulers, that energetic enthusiasm
for a free life, which constituted the fire and essence of
Rousseau's writing. As illustration of this, let us remark how
Rousseau's teaching fared when it fell upon a Catholic country like
France: so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.223" id="Page_i.223">[i.223]</a></span> many of its principles were assimilated by the
revolutionary schools as were wanted for violent dissolvents, while
the rest dropped away, and in this rejected portion was precisely
the most vital part of his system. In other words, in no country
has the power of collective organisation been so pressed and
exalted as in revolutionised France, and in no country has the free
life of the individual been made to count for so little. With such
force does the ancient system of temporal and spiritual
organisation reign in the minds of those who think most confidently
that they have cast it wholly out of them. The use of reason may
lead a man far, but it is the past that has cut the groove.</p>
<p>In re-embracing the Protestant confession, therefore, Rousseau
was not leaving Catholicism, to which he had never really passed
over; he was only undergoing in entire gravity of spirit a
formality which reconciled him with his native city, and reunited
those strands of spiritual connection with it which had never been
more than superficially parted. There can be little doubt that the
four months which he spent in Geneva in 1754 marked a very critical
time in the formation of some of the most memorable of his
opinions. He came from Paris full of inarticulate and smouldering
resentment against the irreverence and denial of the materialistic
circle which used to meet at the house of D'Holbach. What sort of
opinions he found prevailing among the most enlightened of the
Genevese pastors we know from an abundance of sources. D'Alembert
had three or four years later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.224" id="Page_i.224">[i.224]</a></span> than this to suffer a bitter attack
from them, but the account of the creed of some of the ministers
which he gave in his article on Geneva in the Encyclopedia, was
substantially correct. &quot;Many of them,&quot; he wrote, &quot;have ceased to
believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ. Hell, one of the principal
points in our belief, is no longer one with many of the Genevese
pastors, who contend that it is an insult to the Divinity to
imagine that a being full of goodness and justice can be capable of
punishing our faults by an eternity of torment. In a word, they
have no other creed than pure Socinianism, rejecting everything
that they call mysteries, and supposing the first principle of a
true religion to be that it shall propose nothing for belief which
clashes with reason. Religion here is almost reduced to the
adoration of one single God, at least among nearly all who do not
belong to the common people; and a certain respect for Jesus Christ
and the Scriptures is nearly the only thing that distinguishes the
Christianity of Geneva from pure Deism.&quot;<a name="FNanchor240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240">[240]</a> And it would
be easy to trace the growth of these rationalising tendencies.
Throughout the seventeenth century men sprang up who anticipated
some of the rationalistic arguments of the eighteenth, in denying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.225" id="Page_i.225">[i.225]</a></span>
the Trinity, and so forth,<a name="FNanchor241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241">[241]</a> but the time was not then ripe. The
general conditions grew more favourable. Burnet, who was at Geneva
in 1685-6, says that though there were not many among the Genevese
of the first form of learning, &quot;yet almost everybody here has a
good tincture of a learned education.&quot;<a name="FNanchor242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242">[242]</a> The
pacification of civic troubles in 1738 was followed by a quarter of
a century of extreme prosperity and contentment, and it is in such
periods that the minds of men previously trained are wont to turn
to the great matters of speculation. There was at all times a
constant communication, both public and private, going on between
Geneva and Holland, as was only natural between the two chief
Protestant centres of the Continent. The controversy of the
seventeenth century between the two churches was as keenly followed
in Geneva as at Leyden, and there is more than one Genevese writer
who deserves a place in the history of the transition in the
beginning of the eighteenth century from theology proper to that
metaphysical theology, which was the first marked dissolvent of
dogma within the Protestant bodies. To this general movement of the
epoch, of course, Descartes supplied the first impulse. The leader
of the movement in Geneva, that is of an attempt to pacify the
Christian churches on the basis of some such Deism as was shortly
to find its passionate ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.226" id="Page_i.226">[i.226]</a></span>pression in the Savoyard Vicar's
Confession of Faith, was John Alphonse Turretini (1661-1737). He
belonged to a family of Italian refugees from Lucca, and his
grandfather had been sent on a mission to Holland for aid in
defence of Geneva against Catholic Savoy. He went on his travels in
1692; he visited Holland, where he saw Bayle, and England, where he
saw Newton, and France, where he saw Bossuet. Chouet initiated him
into the mysteries of Descartes. All this bore fruit when he
returned home, and his eloquent exposition of rationalistic ideas
aroused the usual cry of heresy from the people who justly insist
that Deism is not Christianity. There was much stir for many years,
but he succeeded in holding his own and in finding many
considerable followers.<a name="FNanchor243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243">[243]</a> For example, some three years or so
after his death, a work appeared in Geneva under the title of <i>La
Religion Essentielle a l'Homme</i>, showing that faith in the
existence of a God suffices, and treating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.227" id="Page_i.227">[i.227]</a></span> with contempt the belief
in the inspiration of the Gospels.<a name="FNanchor244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244">[244]</a></p>
<p>Thus we see what vein of thought was running through the graver
and more active minds of Geneva about the time of Rousseau's visit.
Whether it be true or not that the accepted belief of many of the
preachers was a pure Deism, it is certain that the theory was fully
launched among them, and that those who could not accept it were
still pressed to refute it, and in refuting, to discuss. Rousseau's
friendships were according to his own account almost entirely among
the ministers of religion and the professors of the academy,
precisely the sort of persons who would be most sure to familiarise
him, in the course of frequent conversations, with the current
religious ideas and the arguments by which they were opposed or
upheld. We may picture the effect on his mind of the difference in
tone and temper in these grave, candid, and careful men, and the
tone of his Parisian friends in discussing the same high themes;
how this difference would strengthen his repugnance, and
corroborate his own inborn spirit of veneration; how he would here
feel himself in his own world. For as wise men have noticed, it is
not so much difference of opinion that stirs resentment in us, at
least in great subjects where the difference is not trivial but
profound, as difference in gravity of humour and manner of moral
approach. He returned to Paris (Oct. 1754) warm with the resolution
to give up his concerns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.228" id="Page_i.228">[i.228]</a></span> there, and in the spring go back once and
for all to the city of liberty and virtue, where men revered wisdom
and reason instead of wasting life in the frivolities of literary
dialectic.<a name="FNanchor245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245">[245]</a></p>
<p>The project, however, grew cool. The dedication of his Discourse
on Inequality to the Republic was received with indifference by
some and indignation by others.<a name="FNanchor246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246">[246]</a> Nobody thought it a compliment, and some
thought it an impertinence. This was one reason which turned his
purpose aside. Another was the fact that the illustrious Voltaire
now also signed himself Swiss, and boasted that if he shook his wig
the powder flew over the whole of the tiny Republic. Rousseau felt
certain that Voltaire would make a revolution in Geneva, and that
he should find in his native country the tone, the air, the manners
which were driving him from Paris. From that moment he counted
Geneva lost. Perhaps he ought to make head against the disturber,
but what could he do alone, timid and bad talker as he was, against
a man arrogant, rich, supported by the credit of the great, of
brilliant eloquence, and already the very idol of women and young
men?<a name="FNanchor247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247">[247]</a>
Perhaps it would not be uncharitable to suspect that this was a
reason after the event, for no man was ever so fond as Rousseau, or
so clever a master in the art, of covering an accident in a fine
envelope of principle, and, as we shall see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.229" id="Page_i.229">[i.229]</a></span> he was at this time
writing to Voltaire in strains of effusive panegyric. In this case
he almost tells us that the one real reason why he did not return
to Geneva was that he found a shelter from Paris close at hand.
Even before then he had begun to conceive characteristic doubts
whether his fellow-citizens at Geneva would not be nearly as
hostile to his love of living solitarily and after his own fashion
as the good people of Paris.</p>
<p>Rousseau has told us a pretty story, how one day he and Madame
d'Epinay wandering about the park came upon a dilapidated lodge
surrounded by fruit gardens, in the skirts of the forest of
Montmorency; how he exclaimed in delight at its solitary charm that
here was the very place of refuge made for him; and how on a second
visit he found that his good friend had in the interval had the old
lodge pulled down, and replaced by a pretty cottage exactly
arranged for his own household. &quot;My poor bear,&quot; she said, &quot;here is
your place of refuge; it was you who chose it, 'tis friendship
offers it; I hope it will drive away your cruel notion of going
from me.&quot;<a name="FNanchor248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248">[248]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.230" id="Page_i.230">[i.230]</a></span> Though moved to tears by such kindness,
Rousseau did not decide on the spot, but continued to waver for
some time longer between this retreat and return to Geneva.</p>
<p>In the interval Madame d'Epinay had experience of the character
she was dealing with. She wrote to Rousseau pressing him to live at
the cottage in the forest, and begging him to allow her to assist
him in assuring the moderate annual provision which he had once
accidentally declared to mark the limit of his wants.<a name="FNanchor249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249">[249]</a> He wrote to
her bitterly in reply, that her proposition struck ice into his
soul, and that she could have but sorry appreciation of her own
interests in thus seeking to turn a friend into a valet. He did not
refuse to listen to what she proposed, if only she would remember
that neither he nor his sentiments were for sale.<a name="FNanchor250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250">[250]</a> Madame
d'Epinay wrote to him patiently enough in return, and then Rousseau
hastened to explain that his vocabulary needed special
appreciation, and that he meant by the word valet &quot;the degradation
into which the repudiation of his principles would throw his soul.
The independence I seek is not immunity from work; I am firm for
winning my own bread, I take pleasure in it; but I mean not to
subject myself to any other duty, if I can help it. I will never
pledge any portion of my liberty, either for my own subsistence or
that of any one else. I intend to work, but at my own will and
pleasure, and even to do nothing, if it happens to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.231" id="Page_i.231">[i.231]</a></span> suit me, without
any one finding fault except my stomach.&quot;<a name="FNanchor251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251">[251]</a> We may call
this unamiable, if we please, but in a frivolous world amiability
can hardly go with firm resolve to live an independent life after
your own fashion. The many distasteful sides of Rousseau's
character ought not to hinder us from admiring his steadfastness in
refusing to sacrifice his existence to the first person who spoke
him civilly. We may wish there had been more of rugged simplicity
in his way of dealing with temptations to sell his birthright for a
mess of pottage; less of mere irritability. But then this
irritability is one side of soft temperament. The soft temperament
is easily agitated, and this unpleasant disturbance does not stir
up true anger nor lasting indignation, but only sends quick
currents of eager irritation along the sufferer's nerves. Rousseau,
quivering from head to foot with self-consciousness, is
sufficiently unlike our plain Johnson, the strong-armoured; yet
persistent withstanding of the patron is as worthy of our honour in
one instance as in the other. Indeed, resistance to humiliating
pressure is harder for such a temper as Rousseau's, in which
deliberate endeavour is needed, than it is for the naturally
stoical spirit which asserts itself spontaneously and rises without
effort.</p>
<p>When our born solitary, wearied of Paris and half afraid of the
too friendly importunity of Geneva, at length determined to accept
Madame d'Epinay's offer of the Hermitage on conditions which left
him an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.232" id="Page_i.232">[i.232]</a></span> entire sentiment of independence of movement and freedom
from all sense of pecuniary obligation, he was immediately exposed
to a very copious torrent of pleasantry and remonstrance from the
highly social circle who met round D'Holbach's dinner-table. They
deemed it sheer midsummer madness, or even a sign of secret
depravity, to quit their cheerful world for the dismal solitude of
woods and fields. &quot;Only the bad man is alone,&quot; wrote Diderot in
words which Rousseau kept resentfully in his memory as long as he
lived. The men and women of the eighteenth century had no
comprehension of solitude, the strength which it may impart to the
vigorous, the poetic graces which it may shed about the life of
those who are less than vigorous; and what they did not comprehend,
they dreaded and abhorred, and thought monstrous in the one man who
did comprehend it. They were all of the mind of Socrates when he
said to Ph&#230;drus, &quot;Knowledge is what I love, and the men who
dwell in the town are my teachers, not trees and landscape.&quot;<a name="FNanchor252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252">[252]</a> Sarcasms fell
on him like hail, and the prophecies usual in cases where a stray
soul does not share the common tastes of the herd. He would never
be able to live without the incense and the amusements of the town;
he would be back in a fortnight; he would throw up the whole
enterprise within three months.<a name="FNanchor253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253">[253]</a> Amid a shower of such words, springing
from men's perverse blindness to the binding propriety of keeping
all propositions as to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.233" id="Page_i.233">[i.233]</a></span> is the best way of living in respect of
place, hours, companionship, strictly relative to each individual
case, Rousseau stubbornly shook the dust of the city from off his
feet, and sought new life away from the stridulous hum of men.
Perhaps we are better pleased to think of the unwearied Diderot
spending laborious days in factories and quarries and workshops and
forges, while friendly toilers patiently explained to him the
structure of stocking looms and velvet looms, the processes of
metal-casting and wire-drawing and slate-cutting, and all the other
countless arts and ingenuities of fabrication, which he afterwards
reproduced to a wondering age in his spacious and magnificent
repertory of human thought, knowledge, and practical achievement.
And it is yet more elevating to us to think of the true stoic, the
great high-souled Turgot, setting forth a little later to discharge
beneficent duty in the hard field of his distant Limousin
commissionership, enduring many things and toiling late and early
for long years, that the burden of others might be lighter, and the
welfare of the land more assured. But there are many paths for many
men, and if only magnanimous self-denial has the power of
inspiration, and can move us with the deep thrill of the heroic,
yet every truthful protest, even of excessive personality, against
the gregarious trifling of life in the social groove, has a side
which it is not ill for us to consider, and perhaps for some men
and women in every generation to seek to imitate.</p>

including among much besides that no longer interests men, an

treatise in four parts, <i>De Legibus Naturalibus</i>, in which,
among other matters, he refutes Hobbes and assails the doctrine of
Utility (i. 173, etc.), by limiting its definition to <span lang="el" title="Greek: to pros heauton">&#964;&#959; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span> in its narrowest sense. He appears to have been a
student of Spinoza (i. 326). Francis Turretini, his father, took
part in the discussion as to the nature of the treaty or contract

accuracy of the Confessions, that Madame d'Epinay herself
(<i>M&#233;m.</i>, ii. 115) says that when she began to prepare
the Hermitage for Rousseau he had never been there, and that she
was careful to lead him to believe that the expense had not been
incurred for him. Moreover her letter to him describing it could
only have been written to one who had not seen it, and though her
Memoirs are full of sheer imagination and romance, the documents in
them are substantially authentic, and this letter is shown to be so
by Rousseau's reply to it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII."></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>THE HERMITAGE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would have been a strange anachronism if the decade of the
Encyclop&#230;dia and the Seven Years' War had reproduced one of
those scenes which are as still resting-places amid the ceaseless
forward tramp of humanity, where some holy man turned away from the
world, and with adorable seriousness sought communion with the
divine in mortification of flesh and solitude of spirit. Those were
the retreats of firm hope and beatified faith. The hope and faith
of the eighteenth century were centred in action, not in
contemplation, and the few solitaries of that epoch, as well as of
another nearer to our own, fled away from the impotence of their
own will, rather than into the haven of satisfied conviction and
clear-eyed acceptance. Only one of them&#8212;Wordsworth, the poetic
hermit of our lakes&#8212;impresses us in any degree like one of the
great individualities of the ages when men not only craved for the
unseen, but felt the closeness of its presence over their heads and
about their feet. The modern anchorite goes forth in the spirit of
the preacher who declared all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.235" id="Page_i.235">[i.235]</a></span> the things that are under the sun to
be vanity, not in the transport of the saint who knew all the
things that are under the sun to be no more than the shadow of a
dream in the light of a celestial brightness to come.</p>
<p>Rousseau's mood, deeply tinged as it was by bitterness against
society and circumstance, still contained a strong positive element
in his native exultation in all natural objects and processes,
which did not leave him vacantly brooding over the evil of the
world he had quitted. The sensuousness that penetrated him kept his
sympathy with life extraordinarily buoyant, and all the eager
projects for the disclosure of a scheme of wisdom became for a time
the more vividly desired, as the general tide of desire flowed more
fully within him. To be surrounded with the simplicity of rural
life was with him not only a stimulus, but an essential condition
to free intellectual energy. Many a time, he says, when making
excursions into the country with great people, &quot;I was so tired of
fine rooms, fountains, artificial groves and flower beds, and the
still more tiresome people who displayed all these; I was so worn
out with pamphlets, card-playing, music, silly jokes, stupid airs,
great suppers, that as I spied a poor hawthorn copse, a hedge, a
farmstead, a meadow, as in passing through a hamlet I snuffed the
odour of a good chervil omelette, as I heard from a distance the
rude refrain of the shepherd's songs, I used to wish at the devil
the whole tale of rouge and furbelows.&quot;<a name="FNanchor254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254">[254]</a> He was no
anchorite proper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.236" id="Page_i.236">[i.236]</a></span> one weary of the world and waiting for the end,
but a man with a strong dislike for one kind of life and a keen
liking for another kind. He thought he was now about to reproduce
the old days of the Charmettes, true to his inveterate error that
one may efface years and accurately replace a past. He forgot that
instead of the once vivacious and tender benefactress who was now
waiting for slow death in her hovel, his house-mates would be a
poor dull drudge and her vile mother. He forgot, too, that since
those days the various processes of intellectual life had expanded
within him, and produced a busy fermentation which makes a man's
surroundings very critical. Finally, he forgot that in proportion
as a man suffers the smooth course of his thought to depend on
anything external, whether on the greenness of the field or the
gaiety of the street or the constancy of friends, so comes he
nearer to chance of making shipwreck. Hence his tragedy, though the
very root of the tragedy lay deeper,&#8212;in temperament.</p>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>Rousseau's impatience drove him into the country almost before
the walls of his little house were dry (April 9, 1756). &quot;Although
it was cold, and snow still lay upon the ground, the earth began to
show signs of life; violets and primroses were to be seen; the buds
on the trees were beginning to shoot; and the very night of my
arrival was marked by the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.237" id="Page_i.237">[i.237]</a></span> song of the nightingale. I heard it
close to my window in a wood that touched the house. After a light
sleep I awoke, forgetting that I was transplanted; I thought myself
still in the Rue de Grenelle, when in an instant the warbling of
the birds made me thrill with delight. My very first care was to
surrender myself to the impression of the rustic objects about me.
Instead of beginning by arranging things inside my quarters, I
first set about planning my walks, and there was not a path nor a
copse nor a grove round my cottage which I had not found out before
the end of the next day. The place, which was lonely rather than
wild, transported me in fancy to the end of the world, and no one
could ever have dreamed that we were only four leagues from
Paris.&quot;<a name="FNanchor255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255">[255]</a></p>
<p>This rural delirium, as he justly calls it, lasted for some
days, at the end of which he began seriously to apply himself to
work. But work was too soon broken off by a mood of vehement
exaltation, produced by the stimulus given to all his senses by the
new world of delight in which he found himself. This exaltation was
in a different direction from that which had seized him half a
dozen years before, when he had discarded the usage and costume of
politer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.238" id="Page_i.238">[i.238]</a></span> society, and had begun to conceive an angry contempt for
the manners, prejudices, and maxims of his time. Restoration to a
more purely sensuous atmosphere softened this austerity. No longer
having the vices of a great city before his eyes, he no longer
cherished the wrath which they had inspired in him. &quot;When I did not
see men, I ceased to despise them; and when I had not the bad
before my eyes, I ceased to hate them. My heart, little made as it
is for hate, now did no more than deplore their wretchedness, and
made no distinction between their wretchedness and their badness.
This state, so much more mild, if much less sublime, soon dulled
the glowing enthusiasm that had long transported me.&quot;<a name="FNanchor256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256">[256]</a> That is to
say, his nature remained for a moment not exalted but fairly
balanced. It was only for a moment. And in studying the movements
of impulse and reflection in him at this critical time of his life,
we are hurried rapidly from phase to phase. Once more we are
watching a man who lived without either intellectual or spiritual
direction, swayed by a reminiscence, a passing mood, a personality
accidentally encountered, by anything except permanent aim and
fixed objects, and who would at any time have surrendered the most
deliberately pondered scheme of persistent effort to the
fascination of a cottage slumbering in a bounteous landscape. Hence
there could be no normally composed state for him; the first
soothing effect of the rich life of forest and garden on a nature
exasperated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.239" id="Page_i.239">[i.239]</a></span> by the life of the town passed away, and became
transformed into an exaltation that swept the stoic into space,
leaving sensuousness to sovereign and uncontrolled triumph, until
the delight turned to its inevitable ashes and bitterness.</p>
<p>At first all was pure and delicious. In after times when pain
made him gloomily measure the length of the night, and when fever
prevented him from having a moment of sleep, he used to try to
still his suffering by recollection of the days that he had passed
in the woods of Montmorency, with his dog, the birds, the deer, for
his companions. &quot;As I got up with the sun to watch his rising from
my garden, if I saw the day was going to be fine, my first wish was
that neither letters nor visits might come to disturb its charm.
After having given the morning to divers tasks which I fulfilled
with all the more pleasure that I could put them off to another
time if I chose, I hastened to eat my dinner, so as to escape from
the importunate and make myself a longer afternoon. Before one
o'clock, even on days of fiercest heat, I used to start in the
blaze of the sun, along with my faithful Achates, hurrying my steps
lest some one should lay hold of me before I could get away. But
when I had once passed a certain corner, with what beating of the
heart, with what radiant joy, did I begin to breathe freely, as I
felt myself safe and my own master for the rest of the day! Then
with easier pace I went in search of some wild and desert spot in
the forest, where there was nothing to show the hand of man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.240" id="Page_i.240">[i.240]</a></span> or to
speak of servitude and domination; some refuge where I could fancy
myself its discoverer, and where no inopportune third person came
to interfere between nature and me. She seemed to spread out before
my eyes a magnificence that was always new. The gold of the broom
and the purple of the heather struck my eyes with a glorious
splendour that went to my very heart; the majesty of the trees that
covered me with their shadow, the delicacy of the shrubs that
surrounded me, the astonishing variety of grasses and flowers that
I trod under foot, kept my mind in a continual alternation of
attention and delight.... My imagination did not leave the earth
thus superbly arrayed without inhabitants. I formed a charming
society, of which I did not feel myself unworthy; I made a golden
age to please my own fancy, and filling up these fair days with all
those scenes of my life that had left sweet memories behind, and
all that my heart could yet desire or hope in scenes to come, I
waxed tender even to shedding tears over the true pleasures of
humanity, pleasures so delicious, so pure, and henceforth so far
from the reach of men. Ah, if in such moments any ideas of Paris,
of the age, of my little aureole as author, came to trouble my
dreams, with what disdain did I drive them out, to deliver myself
without distraction to the exquisite sentiments of which I was so
full. Yet in the midst of it all, the nothingness of my chimeras
sometimes broke sadly upon my mind. Even if every dream had
suddenly been transformed into reality, it would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.241" id="Page_i.241">[i.241]</a></span> have been
enough; I should have dreamed, imagined, yearned still.&quot; Alas, this
deep insatiableness of sense, the dreary vacuity of soul that
follows fulness of animal delight, the restless exactingness of
undirected imagination, was never recognised by Rousseau distinctly
enough to modify either his conduct or his theory of life. He
filled up the void for a short space by that sovereign aspiration,
which changed the dead bones of old theology into the living figure
of a new faith. &quot;From the surface of the earth I raised my ideas to
all the existences in nature, to the universal system of things, to
the incomprehensible Being who embraces all. Then with mind lost in
that immensity, I did not think, I did not reason, I did not
philosophise; with a sort of pleasure I felt overwhelmed by the
weight of the universe, I surrendered myself to the ravishing
confusion of these vast ideas. I loved to lose myself in
imagination in immeasurable space; within the limits of real
existences my heart was too tightly compressed; in the universe I
was stifled; I would fain have launched myself into the infinite. I
believe that if I had unveiled all the mysteries of nature, I
should have found myself in a less delicious situation than that
bewildering ecstasy to which my mind so unreservedly delivered
itself, and which sometimes transported me until I cried out, 'O
mighty Being! O mighty Being!' without power of any other word or
thought.&quot;<a name="FNanchor257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257">[257]</a></p>
<p>It is not wholly insignificant that though he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.242" id="Page_i.242">[i.242]</a></span> thus expand
his soul with ejaculatory delight in something supreme, he could
not endure the sight of one of his fellow-creatures. &quot;If my gaiety
lasted the whole night, that showed that I had passed the day
alone; I was very different after I had seen people, for I was
rarely content with others and never with myself. Then in the
evening I was sure to be in taciturn or scolding humour.&quot; It is not
in every condition that effervescent passion for ideal forms of the
religious imagination assists sympathy with the real beings who
surround us. And to this let us add that there are natures in which
all deep emotion is so entirely associated with the ideal, that
real and particular manifestations of it are repugnant to them as
something alien; and this without the least insincerity, though
with a vicious and disheartening inconsistency. Rousseau belonged
to this class, and loved man most when he saw men least. Bad as
this was, it does not justify us in denouncing his love of man as
artificial; it was one side of an ideal exaltation, which stirred
the depths of his spirit with a force as genuine as that which is
kindled in natures of another type by sympathy with the real and
concrete, with the daily walk and conversation and actual doings
and sufferings of the men and women whom we know. The fermentation
which followed his arrival at the Hermitage, in its first form
produced a number of literary schemes. The idea of the Political
Institutions, first conceived at Venice, pressed upon his
meditations. He had been earnestly requested to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.243" id="Page_i.243">[i.243]</a></span> compose a treatise
on education. Besides this, his thoughts wandered confusedly round
the notion of a treatise to be called Sensitive Morality, or the
Materialism of the Sage, the object of which was to examine the
influence of external agencies, such as light, darkness, sound,
seasons, food, noise, silence, motion, rest, on our corporeal
machine, and thus indirectly upon the soul also. By knowing these
and acquiring the art of modifying them according to our individual
needs, we should become surer of ourselves and fix a deeper
constancy in our lives. An external system of treatment would thus
be established, which would place and keep the soul in the
condition most favourable to virtue.<a name="FNanchor258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258">[258]</a> Though the
treatise was never completed, and the sketch never saw the light,
we perceive at least that Rousseau would have made the means of
access to character wide enough, and the material influences that
impress it and produce its caprices, multitudinous enough, instead
of limiting them with the medical specialist to one or two organs,
and one or two of the conditions that affect them. Nor, on the
other hand, do the words in which he sketches his project in the
least justify the attribution to him of the doctrine of the
absolute power of the physical constitution over the moral habits,
whether that doctrine would be a credit or a discredit to his
philosophical thoroughness of perception. No one denies the
influence of external conditions on the moral habits, and Rousseau
says no more than that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.244" id="Page_i.244">[i.244]</a></span> proposed to consider the extent and the
modifiableness of this influence. It was not then deemed essential
for a spiritualist thinker to ignore physical organisation.</p>
<p>A third undertaking of a more substantial sort was to arrange
and edit the papers and printed works of the Abb&#233; de Saint
Pierre (1658-1743), confided to him through the agency of Saint
Lambert, and partly also of Madame Dupin, the warm friend of that
singular and good man.<a name="FNanchor259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259">[259]</a> This task involved reading, considering,
and picking extracts from twenty-three diffuse and chaotic volumes,
full of prolixity and repetition. Rousseau, dreamer as he was, yet
had quite keenness of perception enough to discern the weakness of
a dreamer of another sort; and he soon found out that the
Abb&#233; de Saint Pierre's views were impracticable, in
consequence of the author's fixed idea that men are guided rather
by their lights than by their passions. In fact, Saint Pierre was
penetrated with the eighteenth-century faith to a peculiar degree.
As with Condorcet afterwards, he was led by his admiration for the
extent of modern knowledge to adopt the principle that perfected
reason is capable of being made the base of all institutions, and
would speedily terminate all the great abuses of the world. &quot;He
went wrong,&quot; says Rousseau, &quot;not merely in having no other passion
but that of reason, but by insisting on making all men like
himself, instead of taking them as they are and as they will
continue to be.&quot; The critic's own error<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.245" id="Page_i.245">[i.245]</a></span> in later days was not very
different from this, save that it applied to the medium in which
men live, rather than to themselves, by refusing to take complex
societies as they are, even as starting-points for higher attempts
at organisation. Rousseau had occasionally seen the old man, and he
preserved the greatest veneration for his memory, speaking of him
as the honour of his age and race, with a fulness of enthusiasm
very unusual towards men, though common enough towards inanimate
nature. The sincerity of this respect, however, could not make the
twenty-three volumes which the good man had written, either fewer
in number or lighter in contents, and after dealing as well as he
could with two important parts of Saint Pierre's works, he threw up
the task.<a name="FNanchor260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260">[260]</a> It must not be supposed that Rousseau
would allow that fatigue or tedium had anything to do with a
resolve which really needed no better justification. As we have
seen before, he had amazing skill in finding a certain ingeniously
contrived largeness for his motives. Saint Pierre's writings were
full of observations on the government of France, some of them
remarkably bold in their criticism, but he had not been punished
for them because the ministers always looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.246" id="Page_i.246">[i.246]</a></span> him as a kind of
preacher rather than a genuine politician, and he was allowed to
say what he pleased, because it was observed that no one listened
to what he said. Besides, he was a Frenchman, and Rousseau was not,
and hence the latter, in publishing Saint Pierre's strictures on
French affairs, was exposing himself to a sharp question why he
meddled with a country that did not concern him. &quot;It surprised me,&quot;
says Rousseau, &quot;that the reflection had not occurred to me
earlier,&quot; but this coincidence of the discovery that the work was
imprudent, with the discovery that he was weary of it, will
surprise nobody versed in study of a man who lives in his
sensations, and yet has vanity enough to dislike to admit it.</p>
<p>The short remarks which Rousseau appended to his abridgment of
Saint Pierre's essays on Perpetual Peace, and on a Polysynodia, or
Plurality of Councils, are extremely shrewd and pointed, and would
suffice to show us, if there were nothing else to do so, the right
kind of answer to make to the more harmful dreams of the Social
Contract. Saint Pierre's fault is said, with entire truth, to be a
failure to make his views relative to men, to times, to
circumstances; and there is something that startles us when we
think whose words we are reading, in the declaration that, &quot;whether
an existing government be still that of old times, or whether it
have insensibly undergone a change of nature, it is equally
imprudent to touch it: if it is the same, it must be respected, and
if it has degenerated, that is due to the force of time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.247" id="Page_i.247">[i.247]</a></span>
circumstance, and human sagacity is powerless.&quot; Rousseau points to
France, asking his readers to judge the peril of once moving by an
election the enormous masses comprising the French monarchy; and in
another place, after a wise general remark on the futility of
political machinery without men of a certain character, he
illustrates it by this scornful question: When you see all Paris in
a ferment about the rank of a dancer or a wit, and the affairs of
the academy or the opera making everybody forget the interest of
the ruler and the glory of the nation, what can you hope from
bringing political affairs close to such a people, and removing
them from the court to the town?<a name="FNanchor261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261">[261]</a> Indeed, there is perhaps not one of
these pages which Burke might not well have owned.<a name="FNanchor262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262">[262]</a></p>
<p>A violent and prolonged crisis followed this not entirely
unsuccessful effort after sober and laborious meditation. Rousseau
was now to find that if society has its perils, so too has
solitude, and that if there is evil in frivolous complaisance for
the puppet-work of a world that is only a little serious, so there
is evil in a passionate tenderness for phantoms of an imaginary
world that is not serious at all. To the pure or stoical soul the
solitude of the forest is strength, but then the imagination must
know the yoke. Rousseau's imagination, in no way of the strongest
either as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.248" id="Page_i.248">[i.248]</a></span> receptive or inventive, was the free accomplice of his
sensations. The undisciplined force of animal sensibility gradually
rose within him, like a slowly welling flood. The spectacle does
not either brighten or fortify the student's mind, yet if there are
such states, it is right that those who care to speak of human
nature should have an opportunity of knowing its less glorious
parts. They may be presumed to exist, though in less violent
degree, in many people whom we meet in the street and at the table,
and there can be nothing but danger in allowing ourselves to be so
narrowed by our own virtuousness, viciousness being conventionally
banished to the remoter region of the third person, as to forget
the presence of &quot;the brute brain within the man's.&quot; In Rousseau's
case, at any rate, it was no wicked broth nor magic potion that
&quot;confused the chemic labour of the blood,&quot; but the too potent wine
of the joyful beauty of nature herself, working misery in a mental
structure that no educating care nor envelope of circumstance had
ever hardened against her intoxication. Most of us are protected
against this subtle debauch of sensuous egoism by a cool
organisation, while even those who are born with senses and
appetites of great strength and keenness, are guarded by
accumulated discipline of all kinds from without, especially by the
necessity for active industry which brings the most exaggerated
native sensibility into balance. It is the constant and rigorous
social parade which keeps the eager regiment of the senses from
making furious rout.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.249" id="Page_i.249">[i.249]</a></span> Rousseau had just repudiated all social
obligation, and he had never gone through external discipline. He
was at an age when passion that has never been broken in has the
beak of the bald vulture, tearing and gnawing a man; but its first
approach is in fair shapes.</p>
<p>Wandering and dreaming &quot;in the sweetest season of the year, in
the month of June, under the fresh groves, with the song of the
nightingale and the soft murmuring of the brooks in his ear,&quot; he
began to wonder restlessly why he had never tasted in their
plenitude the vivid sentiments which he was conscious of possessing
in reserve, or any of that intoxicating delight which he felt
potentially existent in his soul. Why had he been created with
faculties so exquisite, to be left thus unused and unfruitful? The
feeling of his own quality, with this of a certain injustice and
waste superadded, brought warm tears which he loved to let flow.
Visions of the past, from girl playmates of his youth down to the
Venetian courtesan, thronged in fluttering tumult into his brain.
He saw himself surrounded by a seraglio of houris whom he had
known, until his blood was all aflame and his head in a whirl. His
imagination was kindled into deadly activity. &quot;The impossibility of
reaching to the real beings plunged me into the land of chimera;
and seeing nothing actual that rose to the height of my delirium, I
nourished it in an ideal world, which my creative imagination had
soon peopled with beings after my heart's desire. In my continual
ecstasies, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.250" id="Page_i.250">[i.250]</a></span> made myself drunk with torrents of the most delicious
sentiments that ever entered the heart of man. Forgetting
absolutely the whole human race, I invented for myself societies of
perfect creatures, as heavenly for their virtues as their beauties;
sure, tender, faithful friends, such as I never found in our nether
world. I had such a passion for haunting this empyrean with all its
charming objects, that I passed hours and days in it without
counting them as they went by; and losing recollection of
everything else, I had hardly swallowed a morsel in hot haste,
before I began to burn to run off in search of my beloved groves.
If, when I was ready to start for the enchanted world, I saw
unhappy mortals coming to detain me on the dull earth, I could
neither moderate nor hide my spleen, and, no longer master over
myself, I used to give them greeting so rough that it might well be
called brutal.&quot;<a name="FNanchor263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263">[263]</a></p>
<p>This terrific malady was something of a very different kind from
the tranquil sensuousness of the days in Savoy, when the blood was
young, and life was not complicated with memories, and the sweet
freshness of nature made existence enough. Then his supreme
expansion had been attended with a kind of divine repose, and had
found edifying voice in devout acknowledgment in the exhilaration
of the morning air of the goodness and bounty of a beneficent
master. In this later and more pitiable time the beneficent master
hid himself, and creation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.251" id="Page_i.251">[i.251]</a></span> only not a blank because it was
veiled by troops of sirens not in the flesh. Nature without the
association of some living human object, like Madame de Warens, was
a poison to Rousseau, until the advancing years which slowly
brought decay of sensual force thus brought the antidote. At our
present point we see one stricken with an ugly disease. It was
almost mercy when he was laid up with a sharp attack of the more
painful, but far less absorbing and frightful disorder, to which
Rousseau was subject all his life long. It gave pause to what he
misnames his angelic loves. &quot;Besides that one can hardly think of
love when suffering anguish, my imagination, which is animated by
the country and under the trees, languishes and dies in a room and
under roof-beams.&quot; This interval he employed with some magnanimity,
in vindicating the ways and economy of Providence, in the letter to
Voltaire which we shall presently examine. The moment he could get
out of doors again into the forest, the transport returned, but
this time accompanied with an active effort in the creative
faculties of his mind to bring the natural relief to these
over-wrought paroxysms of sensual imagination. He soothed his
emotions by associating them with the life of personages whom he
invented, and by introducing into them that play and movement and
changing relation which prevented them from bringing his days to an
end in malodorous fever. The egoism of persistent invention and
composition was at least better than the egoism of mere
unreflecting ecstasy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.252" id="Page_i.252">[i.252]</a></span> in the charm of natural objects, and took off
something from the violent excess of sensuous force. His thought
became absorbed in two female figures, one dark and the other fair,
one sage and the other yielding, one gentle and the other quick,
analogous in character but different, not handsome but animated by
cheerfulness and feeling. To one of these he gave a lover, to whom
the other was a tender friend. He planted them all, after much
deliberation and some changes, on the shores of his beloved lake at
Vevay, the spot where his benefactress was born, and which he
always thought the richest and loveliest in all Europe.</p>
<p>This vicarious or reflected egoism, accompanied as it was by a
certain amount of productive energy, seemed to mark a return to a
sort of moral convalescence. He walked about the groves with pencil
and tablets, assigning this or that thought or expression to one or
other of the three companions of his fancy. When the bad weather
set in, and he was confined to the house (the winter of 1756-7), he
tried to resume his ordinary indoor labour, the copying of music
and the compilation of his Musical Dictionary. To his amazement he
found that this was no longer possible. The fever of that literary
composition of which he had always such dread had strong possession
of him. He could see nothing on any side but the three figures and
the objects about them made beautiful by his imagination. Though he
tried hard to dismiss them, his resistance was vain, and he set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.253" id="Page_i.253">[i.253]</a></span>
himself to bringing some order into his thoughts &quot;so as to produce
a kind of romance.&quot; We have a glimpse of his mental state in the
odd detail, that he could not bear to write his romance on anything
but the very finest paper with gilt edges; that the powder with
which he dried the ink was of azure and sparkling silver; and that
he tied up the quires with delicate blue riband.<a name="FNanchor264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264">[264]</a> The distance
from all this to the state of nature is obviously very great
indeed. It must not be supposed that he forgot his older part as
Cato, Brutus, and the other Plutarchians. &quot;My great embarrassment,&quot;
he says honestly, &quot;was that I should belie myself so clearly and
thoroughly. After the severe principles I had just been laying down
with so much bustle, after the austere maxims I had preached so
energetically, after so many biting invectives against the
effeminate books that breathed love and soft delights, could
anything be imagined more shocking, more unlooked-for, than to see
me inscribe myself with my own hand among the very authors on whose
books I had heaped this harsh censure? I felt this inconsequence in
all its force, I taxed myself with it, I blushed over it, and was
overcome with mortification; but nothing could restore me to
reason.&quot;<a name="FNanchor265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265">[265]</a>
He adds that perhaps on the whole the composition of the New
Helo&#239;sa was turning his madness to the best account. That may
be true, but does not all this make the bitter denunciation, in the
Letter to D'Alembert, of love and of all who make its
repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.254" id="Page_i.254">[i.254]</a></span>sentation a considerable element in literature or the drama,
at the very time when he was composing one of the most dangerously
attractive romances of his century, a rather indecent piece of
invective? We may forgive inconsistency when it is only between two
of a man's theories, or two self-concerning parts of his conduct,
but hardly when it takes the form of reviling in others what the
reviler indulgently permits to himself.</p>
<p>We are more edified by the energy with which Rousseau refused
connivance with the public outrages on morality perpetrated by a
patron. M. d'Epinay went to pay him a visit at the Hermitage,
taking with him two ladies with whom his relations were less than
equivocal, and for whom among other things he had given Rousseau
music to copy. &quot;They were curious to see the eccentric man,&quot; as M.
d'Epinay afterwards told his scandalised wife, for it was in the
manners of the day on no account to parade even the most notorious
of these unblessed connections. &quot;He was walking in front of the
door; he saw me first; he advanced cap in hand; he saw the ladies;
he saluted us, put on his cap, turned his back, and stalked off as
fast as he could. Can anything be more mad?&quot;<a name="FNanchor266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266">[266]</a>  In the
miserable and intricate tangle of falsity, weakness, sensuality,
and quarrel, which make up this chapter in Rousseau's life, we are
glad of even one trait of masculine robustness. We should perhaps
be still more glad if the unwedded Theresa were not visible in the
background of this scene of high morals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.255" id="Page_i.255">[i.255]</a></span></p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>The New Helo&#239;sa was not to be completed without a further
extension of morbid experience of a still more burning kind than
the sufferings of compressed passion. The feverish torment of mere
visions of the air swarming impalpable in all his veins, was
replaced when the earth again began to live and the sap to stir in
plants, by the more concentred fire of a consuming passion for one
who was no dryad nor figure of a dream. In the spring of 1757 he
received a visit from Madame d'Houdetot, the sister-in-law of
Madame d'Epinay.<a name="FNanchor267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267">[267]</a> Her husband had gone to the war (we are
in the year of Rossbach), and so had her lover, Saint Lambert,
whose passion had been so fatal to Voltaire's Marquise du
Ch&#226;telet eight years before. She rode over in man's guise to
the Hermitage from a house not very far off, where she was to pass
her retreat during the absence of her two natural protectors.
Rousseau had seen her before on various occasions; she had been to
the Hermitage the previous year, and had partaken of its host's
homely fare.<a name="FNanchor268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268">[268]</a> But the time was not ripe; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.256" id="Page_i.256">[i.256]</a></span> force of
a temptation is not from without but within. Much, too, depended
with our hermit on the temperature; one who would have been a very
ordinary mortal to him in cold and rain, might grow to Aphrodite
herself in days when the sun shone hot and the air was aromatic.
His fancy was suddenly struck with the romantic guise of the female
cavalier, and this was the first onset of a veritable intoxication,
which many men have felt, but which no man before or since ever
invited the world to hear the story of. He may truly say that after
the first interview with her in this disastrous spring, he was as
one who had thirstily drained a poisoned bowl. A sort of palsy
struck him. He lay weeping in his bed at night, and on days when he
did not see the sorceress he wept in the woods.<a name="FNanchor269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269">[269]</a> He talked to
himself for hours, and was of a black humour to his house-mates.
When approaching the object of this deadly fascination, his whole
organisation seemed to be dissolved. He walked in a dream that
filled him with a sense of sickly torture, commixed with sicklier
delight.</p>
<p>People speak with precisely marked division of mind and body, of
will, emotion, understanding; the division is good in logic, but
its convenient lines are lost to us as we watch a being with soul
all blurred, body all shaken, unstrung, poisoned, by erotic mania,
rising in slow clouds of mephitic steam from suddenly heated
stagnancies of the blood, and turning the reality of conduct and
duty into distant unmeaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.257" id="Page_i.257">[i.257]</a></span> shadows. If such a disease were the
furious mood of the brute in spring-time, it would be less
dreadful, but shame and remorse in the ever-struggling reason of
man or woman in the grip of the foul thing, produces an aggravation
of frenzy that makes the mental healer tremble. Add to all this
lurking elements of hollow rage that his passion was not returned;
of stealthy jealousy of the younger man whose place he could not
take, and who was his friend besides; of suspicion that he was a
little despised for his weakness by the very object of it, who saw
that his hairs were sprinkled with gray,&#8212;and the whole offers a
scene of moral humiliation that half sickens, half appals, and we
turn away with dismay as from a vision of the horrid loves of
heavy-eyed and scaly shapes that haunted the warm primeval
ooze.</p>
<p>Madame d'Houdetot, the unwilling enchantress bearing in an
unconscious hand the cup of defilement, was not strikingly singular
either in physical or mental attraction. She was now
seven-and-twenty. Small-pox, the terrible plague of the country,
had pitted her face and given a yellowish tinge to her complexion;
her features were clumsy and her brow low; she was short-sighted,
and in old age at any rate was afflicted by an excessive squint.
This homeliness was redeemed by a gentle and caressing expression,
and by a sincerity, a gaiety of heart, and free sprightliness of
manner, that no trouble could restrain. Her figure was very slight,
and there was in all her movements at once awkwardness and grace.
She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.258" id="Page_i.258">[i.258]</a></span> natural and simple, and had a fairly good judgment of a
modest kind, in spite of the wild sallies in which her spirits
sometimes found vent. Capable of chagrin, she was never prevented
by it from yielding to any impulse of mirth. &quot;She weeps with the
best faith in the world, and breaks out laughing at the same
moment; never was anybody so happily born,&quot; says her much less
amiable sister-in-law.<a name="FNanchor270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270">[270]</a> Her husband was indifferent to her. He
preserved an attachment to a lady whom he knew before his marriage,
whose society he never ceased to frequent, and who finally died in
his arms in 1793. Madame d'Houdetot found consolation in the
friendship of Saint Lambert. &quot;We both of us,&quot; said her husband,
&quot;both Madame d'Houdetot and I, had a vocation for fidelity, only
there was a mis-arrangement.&quot; She occasionally composed verses of
more than ordinary point, but she had good sense enough not to
write them down, nor to set up on the strength of them for poetess
and wit.<a name="FNanchor271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271">[271]</a>
Her talk in her later years, and she lived down to the year of
Leipsic, preserved the pointed sententiousness of earlier time. One
day, for instance, in the era of the Directory, a conversation was
going on as to the various merits and defects of women; she heard
much, and then with her accustomed suavity of voice contributed
this light summary:&#8212;&quot;Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.259" id="Page_i.259">[i.259]</a></span> women, the life of man would be
without aid at the beginning, without pleasure in the middle, and
without solace at the end.&quot;<a name="FNanchor272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272">[272]</a></p>
<p>We may be sure that it was not her power of saying things of
this sort that kindled Rousseau's flame, but rather the sprightly
naturalness, frankness, and kindly softness of a character which in
his opinion united every virtue except prudence and strength, the
two which Rousseau would be least likely to miss. The bond of union
between them was subtle. She found in Rousseau a sympathetic
listener while she told the story of her passion for Saint Lambert,
and a certain contagious force produced in him a thrill which he
never felt with any one else before or after. Thus, as he says,
there was equally love on both sides, though it was not reciprocal.
&quot;We were both of us intoxicated with passion, she for her lover, I
for her; our sighs and sweet tears mingled. Tender confidants, each
of the other, our sentiments were of such close kin that it was
impossible for them not to mix; and still she never forgot her duty
for a moment, while for myself, I protest, I swear, that if
sometimes drawn astray by my senses, still&quot;&#8212;still he was a paragon
of virtue, subject to rather new definition. We can appreciate the
author of the New Helo&#239;sa; we can appreciate the author of
Emilius; but this strained attempt to confound those two very
different persons by combining tearful erotics with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.260" id="Page_i.260">[i.260]</a></span> high ethics, is
an exhibition of self-delusion that the most patient analyst of
human nature might well find hard to suffer. &quot;The duty of privation
exalted my soul. The glory of all the virtues adorned the idol of
my heart in my sight; to soil its divine image would have been to
annihilate it,&quot; and so forth.<a name="FNanchor273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273">[273]</a> Moon-lighted landscape gave a background
for the sentimentalist's picture, and dim groves, murmuring
cascades, and the soft rustle of the night air, made up a scene
which became for its chief actor &quot;an immortal memory of innocence
and delight.&quot; &quot;It was in this grove, seated with her on a grassy
bank, under an acacia heavy with flowers, that I found expression
for the emotions of my heart in words that were worthy of them.
'Twas the first and single time of my life; but I was sublime, if
you can use the word of all the tender and seductive things that
the most glowing love can bring into the heart of a man. What
intoxicating tears I shed at her knees, what floods she shed in
spite of herself! At length in an involuntary transport, she cried
out, 'Never was man so tender, never did man love as you do! But
your friend Saint Lambert hears us, and my heart cannot love
twice.'&quot;<a name="FNanchor274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274">[274]</a>
Happily, as we learn from another source, a breath of wholesome
life from without brought the transcendental to grotesque end. In
the climax of tears and protestations, an honest waggoner at the
other side of the park wall, urging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.261" id="Page_i.261">[i.261]</a></span> on a lagging beast launched a
round and far-sounding oath out into the silent night. Madame
d'Houdetot answered with a lively continuous peal of young
laughter, while an angry chill brought back the discomfited lover
from an ecstasy that was very full of peril.<a name="FNanchor275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275">[275]</a></p>
<p>Rousseau wrote in the New Helo&#239;sa very sagely that you
should grant to the senses nothing when you mean to refuse them
anything. He admits that the saying was falsified by his relations
with Madame d'Houdetot. Clearly the credit of this happy
falsification was due to her rather than to himself. What her
feelings were, it is not very easy to see. Honest pity seems to
have been the strongest of them. She was idle and unoccupied, and
idleness leaves the soul open for much stray generosity of emotion,
even towards an importunate lover. She thought him mad, and she
wrote to Saint Lambert to say so. &quot;His madness must be very
strong,&quot; said Saint Lambert, &quot;since she can perceive it.&quot;<a name="FNanchor276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276">[276]</a></p>
<p>Character is ceaselessly marching, even when we seem to have
sunk into a fixed and stagnant mood. The man is awakened from his
dream of passion by inexorable event; he finds the house of the
soul not swept and garnished for a new life, but possessed by
demons who have entered unseen. In short, such profound disorder of
spirit, though in its first stage marked by ravishing delirium,
never escapes a bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.262" id="Page_i.262">[i.262]</a></span> sequel. When a man lets his soul be swept
away from the narrow track of conduct appointed by his relations
with others, still the reality of such relations survives. He may
retreat to rural lodges; that will not save him either from his own
passion, or from some degree of that kinship with others which
instantly creates right and wrong like a wall of brass around him.
Let it be observed that the natures of finest stuff suffer most
from these forced reactions, and it was just because Rousseau had
innate moral sensitiveness, and a man like Diderot was without it,
that the first felt his fall so profoundly, while the second was
unconscious of having fallen at all.</p>
<p>One day in July Rousseau went to pay his accustomed visit. He
found Madame d'Houdetot dejected, and with the flush of recent
weeping on her cheeks. A bird of the air had carried the matter. As
usual, the matter was carried wrongly, and apparently all that
Saint Lambert suspected was that Rousseau's high principles had
persuaded Madame d'Houdetot of the viciousness of her relations
with her lover.<a name="FNanchor277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277">[277]</a> &quot;They have played us an evil turn,&quot;
cried Madame d'Houdetot; &quot;they have been unjust to me, but that is
no matter. Either let us break off at once, or be what you ought to
be.&quot;<a name="FNanchor278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278">[278]</a>
This was Rousseau's first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.263" id="Page_i.263">[i.263]</a></span> taste of the ashes of shame into which
the lusciousness of such forbidden fruit, plucked at the expense of
others, is ever apt to be transformed. Mortification of the
considerable spiritual pride that was yet alive after this lapse,
was a strong element in the sum of his emotion, and it was pointed
by the reflection which stung him so incessantly, that his
monitress was younger than himself. He could never master his own
contempt for the gallantry of grizzled locks.<a name="FNanchor279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279">[279]</a> His austerer
self might at any rate have been consoled by knowing that this
scene was the beginning of the end, though the end came without any
seeking on his part and without violence. To his amazement, one day
Saint Lambert and Madame d'Houdetot came to the Hermitage, asking
him to give them dinner, and much to the credit of human nature's
elasticity, the three passed a delightful afternoon. The wronged
lover was friendly, though a little stiff, and he passed occasional
slights which Rousseau would surely not have forgiven, if he had
not been disarmed by consciousness of guilt. He fell asleep, as we
can well imagine that he might do, while Rousseau read aloud his
very inadequate justification of Providence against
Voltaire.<a name="FNanchor280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280">[280]</a></p>
<p>In time he returned to the army, and Rousseau began to cure
himself of his mad passion. His method, however, was not
unsuspicious, for it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.264" id="Page_i.264">[i.264]</a></span>volved the perilous assistance of Madame
d'Houdetot. Fortunately her loyalty and good sense forced a more
resolute mode upon him. He found, or thought he found her
distracted, emharrassed, indifferent. In despair at not being
allowed to heal his passionate malady in his own fashion, he did
the most singular thing that he could have done under the
circumstances. He wrote to Saint Lambert.<a name="FNanchor281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281">[281]</a> His letter is
a prodigy of plausible duplicity, though Rousseau in some of his
mental states had so little sense of the difference between the
actual and the imaginary, and was moreover so swiftly borne away on
a flood of fine phrases, that it is hard to decide how far this was
voluntary, and how far he was his own dupe. Voluntary or not, it is
detestable. We pass the false whine about &quot;being abandoned by all
that was dear to him,&quot; as if he had not deliberately quitted Paris
against the remonstrance of every friend he had; about his being
&quot;solitary and sad,&quot; as if he was not ready at this very time to
curse any one who intruded on his solitude, and hindered him of a
single half-hour in the desert spots that he adored. Remembering
the scenes in moon-lighted groves and elsewhere, we read
this:&#8212;&quot;Whence comes her coldness to me? Is it possible that you
can have suspected me of wronging you with her, and of turning
perfidious in consequence of an unseasonably rigorous virtue? A
passage in one of your letters shows a glimpse of some such
suspicion. No, no, Saint Lambert, the breast of J.J. Rousseau never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.265" id="Page_i.265">[i.265]</a></span>
held the heart of a traitor, and I should despise myself more than
you suppose, if I had ever tried to rob you of her heart.... Can you
suspect that her friendship for me may hurt her love for you?
Surely natures endowed with sensibility are open to all sorts of
affections, and no sentiment can spring up in them which does not
turn to the advantage of the dominant passion. Where is the lover
who does not wax the more tender as he talks to his friend of her
whom he loves? And is it not sweeter for you in your banishment
that there should be some sympathetic creature to whom your
mistress loves to talk of you, and who loves to hear?&quot;</p>
<p>Let us turn to another side of his correspondence. The way in
which the sympathetic creature in the present case loved to hear
his friend's mistress talk of him, is interestingly shown in one or
two passages from a letter to her; as when he cries, &quot;Ah, how proud
would even thy lover himself be of thy constancy, if he only knew
how much it has surmounted.... I appeal to your sincerity. You, the
witness and the cause of this delirium, these tears, these
ravishing ecstasies, these transports which were never made for
mortal, say, have I ever tasted your favours in such a way that I
deserve to lose them?... Never once did my ardent desires nor my
tender supplications dare to solicit supreme happiness, without my
feeling stopped by the inner cries of a sorrow-stricken soul.... O
Sophie, after moments so sweet, the idea of eternal privation is
too frightful for one who groans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.266" id="Page_i.266">[i.266]</a></span> that he cannot identify himself
with thee. What, are thy tender eyes never again to be lowered with
a delicious modesty, intoxicating me with pleasure? What, are my
burning lips never again to lay my very soul on thy heart along
with my kisses? What, may I never more feel that heavenly shudder,
that rapid and devouring fire, swifter than lightning?&quot;<a name="FNanchor282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282">[282]</a>.... We see a
sympathetic creature assuredly, and listen to the voice of a nature
endowed with sensibility even more than enough, but with decency,
loyalty, above all with self-knowledge, far less than enough.</p>
<p>One more touch completes the picture of the fallen desperate
man. He takes great trouble to persuade Saint Lambert that though
the rigour of his principles constrains him to frown upon such
breaches of social law as the relations between Madame d'Houdetot
and her lover, yet he is so attached to the sinful pair that he
half forgives them. &quot;Do not suppose,&quot; he says, with superlative
gravity, &quot;that you have seduced me by your reasons; I see in them
the goodness of your heart, not your justification. I cannot help
blaming your connection: you can hardly approve it yourself; and so
long as you both of you continue dear to me, I will never leave you
in careless security as to the innocence of your state. Yet love
such as yours deserves considerateness.... I feel respect for a
union so tender, and cannot bring myself to attempt to lead it to
virtue along the path of despair&quot; (p. 401).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.267" id="Page_i.267">[i.267]</a></span></p>

<p>Ignorance of the facts of the case hindered Saint Lambert from
appreciating the strange irony of a man protesting about leading to
virtue along the path of despair a poor woman whom he had done as
much as he could to lead to vice along the path of highly
stimulated sense. Saint Lambert was as much a sentimentalist as
Rousseau was, but he had a certain manliness, acquired by long
contact with men, which his correspondent only felt in moods of
severe exaltation. Saint Lambert took all the blame on himself. He
had desired that his mistress and his friend should love one
another; then he thought he saw some coolness in his mistress, and
he set the change down to his friend, though not on the true
grounds. &quot;Do not suppose that I thought you perfidious or a
traitor; I knew the austerity of your principles; people had spoken
to me of it; and she herself did so with a respect that love found
hard to bear.&quot; In short, he had suspected Rousseau of nothing worse
than being over-virtuous, and trying in the interest of virtue to
break off a connection sanctioned by contemporary manners, but not
by law or religion. If Madame d'Houdetot had changed, it was not
that she had ceased to honour her good friend, but only that her
lover might be spared a certain chagrin, from suspecting the excess
of scrupulosity and conscience in so austere an adviser.<a name="FNanchor283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283">[283]</a></p>
<p>It is well known how effectively one with a germ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.268" id="Page_i.268">[i.268]</a></span> of good
principle in him is braced by being thought better than he is. With
this letter in his hands and its words in his mind, Rousseau strode
off for his last interview with Madame d'Houdetot. Had Saint
Lambert, he says, been less wise, less generous, less worthy, I
should have been a lost man. As it was, he passed four or five
hours with her in a delicious calm, infinitely more delightful than
the accesses of burning fever which had seized him before. They
formed the project of a close companionship of three, including the
absent lover; and they counted on the project coming more true than
such designs usually do, &quot;since all the feelings that can unite
sensitive and upright hearts formed the foundation of it, and we
three united talents enough as well as knowledge enough to suffice
to ourselves, without need of aid or supplement from others.&quot; What
happened was this. Madame d'Houdetot for the next three or four
months, which were among the most bitter in Rousseau's life, for
then the bitterness which became chronic was new and therefore
harder to be borne, wrote him the wisest, most affectionate, and
most considerate letters that a sincere and sensible woman ever
wrote to the most petulant, suspicious, perverse, and
irrestrainable of men. For patience and exquisite sweetness of
friendship some of these letters are matchless, and we can only
conjecture the wearing querulousness of the letters to which they
were replies. If through no fault of her own she had been the
occasion of the monstrous delirium of which he never shook off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.269" id="Page_i.269">[i.269]</a></span>
consequences, at least this good soul did all that wise counsel and
grave tenderness could do, to bring him out of the black slough of
suspicion and despair into which he was plunged.<a name="FNanchor284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284">[284]</a> In the
beginning of 1758 there was a change. Rousseau's passion for her
somehow became known to all the world; it reached the ears of Saint
Lambert, and was the cause of a passing disturbance between him and
his mistress. Saint Lambert throughout acted like a man who is
thoroughly master of himself. At first, we learn, he ceased for a
moment to see in Rousseau the virtue which he sought in him, and
which he was persuaded that he found in him. &quot;Since then, however,&quot;
wrote Madame d'Houdetot, &quot;he pities you more for your weakness than
he reproaches you, and we are both of us far from joining the
people who wish to blacken your character; we have and always shall
have the courage to speak of you with esteem.&quot;<a name="FNanchor285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285">[285]</a> They saw one
another a few times, and on one occasion the Count and Countess
d'Houdetot, Saint Lambert, and Rousseau all sat at table together,
happily without breach of the peace.<a name="FNanchor286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286">[286]</a> One curious
thing about this meeting was that it took place some three weeks
after Rousseau and Saint Lambert had interchanged letters on the
subject of the quarrel with Diderot, in which each promised the
other contemptuous oblivion.<a name="FNanchor287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287">[287]</a> Per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.270" id="Page_i.270">[i.270]</a></span>petuity of hate is as hard as
perpetuity of love for our poor short-spanned characters, and at
length the three who were once to have lived together in
self-sufficing union, and then in their next mood to have forgotten
one another instantly and for ever, held to neither of the
extremes, but settled down into an easier middle path of
indifferent good-will. The conduct of all three, said the most
famous of them, may serve for an example of the way in which
sensible people separate, when it no longer suits them to see one
another.<a name="FNanchor288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288">[288]</a>
It is at least certain that in them Rousseau lost two of the most
unimpeachably good friends that he ever possessed.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>The egoistic character that loves to brood and hates to act, is
big with catastrophe. We have now to see how the inevitable law
accomplished itself in the case of Rousseau. In many this brooding
egoism produces a silent and melancholy insanity; with him it was
developed into something of acridly corrosive quality. One of the
agents in this disastrous process was the wearing torture of one of
the most painful of disorders. This disorder, arising from an
internal malformation, harassed him from his infancy to the day of
his death. Our fatuous persistency in reducing man to the
spiritual, blinds the biographer to the circumstance that the
history of a life is the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.271" id="Page_i.271">[i.271]</a></span> a body no less than that of a
soul. Many a piece of conduct that divides the world into two
factions of moral assailants and moral vindicators, provoking a
thousand ingenuities of ethical or psychological analysis, ought
really to have been nothing more than an item in a page of a
pathologist's case-book. We are not to suspend our judgment on
action; right and wrong can depend on no man's malformations. In
trying to know the actor, it is otherwise; here it is folly to
underestimate the physical antecedents of mental phenomena. In firm
and lofty character, pain is mastered; in a character so little
endowed with cool tenacious strength as Rousseau's, pain such as he
endured was enough to account, not for his unsociality, which
flowed from temperament, but for the bitter, irritable, and
suspicious form which this unsociality now first assumed. Rousseau
was never a saintly nature, but far the reverse, and in reading the
tedious tale of his quarrels with Grimm and Madame d'Epinay and
Diderot&#8212;a tale of labyrinthine nightmares&#8212;let us remember that we
may even to this point explain what happened, without recourse to
the too facile theory of insanity, unless one defines that misused
term so widely as to make many sane people very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>His own account was this: &quot;In my quality of solitary, I am more
sensitive than another; if I am wrong with a friend who lives in
the world, he thinks of it for a moment, and then a thousand
distractions make him forget it for the rest of the day; but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.272" id="Page_i.272">[i.272]</a></span>
is nothing to distract me as to his wrong towards me; deprived of
my sleep, I busy myself with him all night long; solitary in my
walks, I busy myself with him from sunrise until sunset; my heart
has not an instant's relief, and the harshness of a friend gives me
in one day years of anguish. In my quality of invalid, I have a
title to the considerateness that humanity owes to the weakness or
irritation of a man in agony. Who is the friend, who is the good
man, that ought not to dread to add affliction to an unfortunate
wretch tormented with a painful and incurable malady?&quot;<a name="FNanchor289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289">[289]</a>  We need not
accept this as an adequate extenuation of perversities, but it
explains them without recourse to the theory of uncontrollable
insanity. Insanity came later, the product of intellectual
excitation, public persecution, and moral reaction after prolonged
tension. Meanwhile he may well be judged by the standards of the
sane; knowing his temperament, his previous history, his
circumstances, we have no difficulty in accounting for his conduct.
Least of all is there any need for laying all the blame upon his
friends. There are writers whom enthusiasm for the principles of
Jean Jacques has driven into fanatical denigration of every one
whom he called his enemy, that is to say, nearly every one whom he
ever knew.<a name="FNanchor290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290">[290]</a> Diderot said well, &quot;Too many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.273" id="Page_i.273">[i.273]</a></span> honest
people would be wrong, if Jean Jacques were right.&quot;</p>
<p>The first downright breach was with Grimm, but there were angry
passages during the year 1757, not only with him, but with Diderot
and Madame d'Epinay as well. Diderot, like many other men of
energetic nature unchastened by worldly wisdom, was too interested
in everything that attracted his attention to keep silence over the
indiscretion of a friend. He threw as much tenacity and zeal into a
trifle, if it had once struck him, as he did into the
Encyclop&#230;dia. We have already seen how warmly he rated Jean
Jacques for missing the court pension. Then he scolded and laughed
at him for turning hermit. With still more seriousness he
remonstrated with him for remaining in the country through the
winter, thus endangering the life of Theresa's aged mother. This
stirred up hot anger in the Hermitage, and two or three bitter
letters were interchanged,<a name="FNanchor291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291">[291]</a> those of Diderot being pronounced by a
person who was no partisan of Rousseau decidedly too harsh.<a name="FNanchor292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292">[292]</a> Yet there is
copious warmth of friendship in these very letters, if only the man
to whom they were written had not hated interference in his affairs
as the worst of injuries. &quot;I loved Diderot tenderly, I esteemed him
sincerely,&quot; says Rousseau, &quot;and I counted with entire confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.274" id="Page_i.274">[i.274]</a></span>
upon the same sentiments in him. But worn out by his unwearied
obstinacy in everlastingly thwarting my tastes, my inclinations, my
ways of living, everything that concerned myself only; revolted at
seeing a younger man than myself insist with all his might on
governing me like a child; chilled by his readiness in giving his
promise and his negligence in keeping it; tired of so many
appointments which he made and broke, and of his fancy for
repairing them by new ones to be broken in their turn; provoked at
waiting for him to no purpose three or four times a month on days
which he had fixed, and of dining alone in the evening, after going
on as far as St. Denis to meet him and waiting for him all day,&#8212;I
had my heart already full of a multitude of grievances.&quot;<a name="FNanchor293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293">[293]</a> This
irritation subsided in presence of the storms that now rose up
against Diderot. He was in the thick of the dangerous and
mortifying distractions stirred up by the foes of the
Encyclop&#230;dia. Rousseau in friendly sympathy went to see him;
they embraced, and old wrongs were forgotten until new
arose.<a name="FNanchor294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294">[294]</a></p>
<p>There is a less rose-coloured account than this. Madame d'Epinay
assigns two motives to Rousseau: a desire to find an excuse for
going to Paris, in order to avoid seeing Saint Lambert; secondly, a
wish to hear Diderot's opinion of the two first parts of the New
Helo&#239;sa. She says that he wanted to borrow a portfolio in
which to carry the manuscripts to Paris;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.275" id="Page_i.275">[i.275]</a></span> Rousseau says that they
had already been in Diderot's possession for six months.<a name="FNanchor295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295">[295]</a> As her letters
containing this very circumstantial story were written at the
moment, it is difficult to uphold the Confessions as valid
authority against them. Thirdly, Rousseau told her that he had not
taken his manuscripts to Paris (p. 302), whereas Grimm writing a
few days later (p. 309) mentions that he has received a letter from
Diderot, to the effect that Rousseau's visit had no other object
than the revision of these manuscripts. The scene is
characteristic. &quot;Rousseau kept him pitilessly at work from Saturday
at ten o'clock in the morning till eleven at night on Monday,
hardly giving him time to eat and drink. The revision at an end,
Diderot chats with him about a plan he has in his head, and begs
Rousseau to help him in contriving some incident which he cannot
yet arrange to his taste. 'It is too difficult,' replies the hermit
coldly, 'it is late, and I am not used to sitting up. Good night; I
am off at six in the morning, and 'tis time for bed.' He rises from
his chair, goes to bed, and leaves Diderot petrified at his
behaviour. The day of his departure, Diderot's wife saw that her
husband was in bad spirits, and asked the reason. 'It is that man's
want of delicacy,' he replied, 'which afflicts me; he makes me work
like a slave, but I should never have found that out, if he had not
so drily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.276" id="Page_i.276">[i.276]</a></span> refused to take an interest in me for a quarter of an
hour.' 'You are surprised at that,' his wife answered; 'do you not
know him? He is devoured with envy; he goes wild with rage when
anything fine appears that is not his own. You will see him one day
commit some great crime rather than let himself be ignored. I
declare I would not swear that he will not join the ranks of the
Jesuits, and undertake their vindication.'&quot;</p>
<p>Of course we cannot be sure that Grimm did not manipulate these
letters long after the event, but there is nothing in Rousseau's
history to make us perfectly sure that he was incapable either of
telling a falsehood to Madame d'Epinay, or of being shamelessly
selfish in respect of Diderot. I see no reason to refuse
substantial credit to Grimm's account, and the points of
coincidence between that and the Confessions make its truth
probable.<a name="FNanchor296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296">[296]</a></p>
<p>Rousseau's relations with Madame d'Epinay were more complex, and
his sentiments towards her underwent many changes. There was a
prevalent opinion that he was her lover, for which no real
foundation seems to have existed.<a name="FNanchor297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297">[297]</a> Those who disbelieved that he had
reached this distinction, yet made sure that he had a passion for
her, which may or may not have been true.<a name="FNanchor298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298">[298]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.277" id="Page_i.277">[i.277]</a></span> Madame
d'Epinay herself was vain enough to be willing that this should be
generally accepted, and it is certain that she showed a friendship
for him which, considering the manners of the time, was invitingly
open to misconception. Again, she was jealous of her sister-in-law,
Madame d'Houdetot, if for no other reason than that the latter,
being the wife of a Norman noble, had access to the court, and this
was unattainable by the wife of a farmer-general. Hence Madame
d'Epinay's barely-concealed mortification when she heard of the
meetings in the forest, the private suppers, the moonlight rambles
in the park. When Saint Lambert first became uneasy as to the
relations between Rousseau and his mistress, and wrote to her to
say that he was so, Rousseau instantly suspected that Madame
d'Epinay had been his informant. Theresa confirmed the suspicion by
tales of baskets and drawers ransacked by Madame d'Epinay in search
of Madame d'Houdetot's letters to him. Whether these tales were
true or not, we can never know; we can only say that Madame
d'Epinay was probably not incapable of these meannesses, and that
there is no reason to suppose that she took the pains to write
directly to Saint Lambert a piece of news which she was writing to
Grimm, knowing that he was then in communication with Saint
Lambert. She herself suspected that Theresa had written to Saint
Lambert,<a name="FNanchor299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299">[299]</a>
but it may be doubted whether Theresa's imagination could have
risen to such feat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.278" id="Page_i.278">[i.278]</a></span> as writing to a marquis, and a marquis in what
would have seemed to her to be remote and inaccessible parts of the
earth. All this, however, has become ghostly for us; a puzzle that
can never be found out, nor be worth finding out. Rousseau was
persuaded that Madame d'Epinay was his betrayer, and was seized by
one of his blackest and most stormful moods. In reply to an
affectionate letter from her, inquiring why she had not seen him
for so long, he wrote thus: &quot;I can say nothing to you yet. I wait
until I am better informed, and this I shall be sooner or later.
Meanwhile, be certain that accused innocence will find a champion
ardent enough to make calumniators repent, whoever they may be.&quot; It
is rather curious that so strange a missive as this, instead of
provoking Madame d'Epinay to anger, was answered by a warmer and
more affectionate letter than the first. To this Rousseau replied
with increased vehemence, charged with dark and mysteriously worded
suspicion. Still Madame d'Epinay remained willing to receive him.
He began to repent of his imprudent haste, because it would
certainly end by compromising Madame d'Houdetot, and because,
moreover, he had no proof after all that his suspicions had any
foundation. He went instantly to the house of Madame d'Epinay; at
his approach she threw herself on his neck and melted into tears.
This unexpected reception from so old a friend moved him extremely;
he too wept abundantly. She showed no curiosity as to the precise
nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.279" id="Page_i.279">[i.279]</a></span> his suspicions or their origin, and the quarrel came to
an end.<a name="FNanchor300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300">[300]</a></p>
<p>Grimm's turn followed. Though they had been friends for many
years, there had long been a certain stiffness in their friendship.
Their characters were in fact profoundly antipathetic. Rousseau we
know,&#8212;sensuous, impulsive, extravagant, with little sense of the
difference between reality and dreams. Grimm was exactly the
opposite; judicious, collected, self-seeking, coldly upright. He
was a German (born at Ratisbon), and in Paris was first a reader to
the Duke of Saxe Gotha, with very scanty salary. He made his way,
partly through the friendship of Rousseau, into the society of the
Parisian men of letters, rapidly acquired a perfect mastery of the
French language, and with the inspiring help of Diderot, became an
excellent critic. After being secretary to sundry high people, he
became the literary correspondent of various German sovereigns,
keeping them informed of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.280" id="Page_i.280">[i.280]</a></span> was happening in the world of art and
letters, just as an ambassador keeps his government informed of
what happens in politics. The sobriety, impartiality, and
discrimination of his criticism make one think highly of his
literary judgment; he had the courage, or shall we say he preserved
enough of the German, to defend both Homer and Shakespeare against
the unhappy strictures of Voltaire.<a name="FNanchor301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301">[301]</a> This is not
all, however; his criticism is conceived in a tone which impresses
us with the writer's integrity. And to this internal evidence we
have to add the external corroboration that in the latter part of
his life he filled various official posts, which implied a peculiar
confidence in his probity on the part of those who appointed him.
At the present moment (1756-57), he was acting as secretary to
Marshal d'Estr&#233;es, commander of the French army in
Westphalia at the outset of the Seven Years' War. He was an able
and helpful man, in spite of his having a rough manner, powdering
his face, and being so monstrously scented as to earn the name of
the musk-bear. He had that firmness and positivity which are not
always beautiful, but of which there is probably too little rather
than too much in the world, certainly in the France of his time,
and of which there was none at all in Rousseau. Above all things he
hated declamation. Apparently cold and reserved, he had sensibility
enough underneath the surface to go nearly out of his mind for love
of a singer at the opera who had a thrilling voice. As he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.281" id="Page_i.281">[i.281]</a></span> not
believe in the metaphysical doctrine about the freedom of the will,
he accepted from temperament the necessity which logic confirmed,
of guiding the will by constant pressure from without. &quot;I am
surprised,&quot; Madame d'Epinay said to him, &quot;that men should be so
little indulgent to one another.&quot; &quot;Nay, the want of indulgence
comes of our belief in freedom; it is because the established
morality is false and bad, inasmuch as it starts from this false
principle of liberty.&quot; &quot;Ah, but the contrary principle, by making
one too indulgent, disturbs order.&quot; &quot;It does nothing of the kind.
Though man does not wholly change, he is susceptible of
modification; you can improve him; hence it is not useless to
punish him. The gardener does not cut down a tree that grows
crooked; he binds up the branch and keeps it in shape; that is the
effect of public punishment.&quot;<a name="FNanchor302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302">[302]</a> He applied the same doctrine, as we
shall see, to private punishment for social crookedness.</p>
<p>It is easy to conceive how Rousseau's way of ordering himself
would gradually estrange so hard a head as this. What the one
thought a weighty moral reformation, struck the other as a vain
desire to attract attention. Rousseau on the other hand suspected
Grimm of intriguing to remove Theresa from him, as well as doing
his best to alienate all his friends. The attempted alienation of
Theresa consisted in the secret allowance to her mother and her by
Grimm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.282" id="Page_i.282">[i.282]</a></span> Diderot of some sixteen pounds a year.<a name="FNanchor303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303">[303]</a> Rousseau was
unaware of this, but the whisperings and goings and comings to
which it gave rise, made him darkly uneasy. That the suspicions in
other respects were in a certain sense not wholly unfounded, is
shown by Grimm's own letters to Madame d'Epinay. He disapproved of
her installing Rousseau in the Hermitage, and warned her in a very
remarkable prophecy that solitude would darken his
imagination.<a name="FNanchor304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304">[304]</a> &quot;He is a poor devil who torments
himself, and does not dare to confess the true subject of all his
sufferings, which is in his cursed head and his pride; he raises up
imaginary matters, so as to have the pleasure of complaining of the
whole human race.&quot;<a name="FNanchor305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305">[305]</a> More than once he assures her that
Rousseau will end by going mad, it being impossible that so hot and
ill-organised a head should endure solitude.<a name="FNanchor306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306">[306]</a> Rousseauite
partisans usually explain all this by supposing that Grimm was
eager to set a woman for whom he had a passion, against a man who
was suspected of having a passion for her; and it is possible that
jealousy may have stimulated the exercise of his natural
shrewdness. But this shrewdness, added to entire want of
imagination and a very narrow range of sympathy, was quite enough
to account for Grimm's harsh judgment, without the addition of any
sinister sentiment. He was perfectly right in suspecting Rousseau
of want of loyalty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.283" id="Page_i.283">[i.283]</a></span> Madame d'Epinay, for we find our hermit
writing to her in strains of perfect intimacy, while he was writing
of her to Madame d'Houdetot as &quot;your unworthy sister.&quot;<a name="FNanchor307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307">[307]</a> On the other
hand, while Madame d'Epinay was overwhelming him with caressing
phrases, she was at the same moment describing him to Grimm as a
master of impertinence and intractableness. As usual where there is
radical incompatibility of character, an attempted reconciliation
between Grimm and Rousseau (some time in the early part of October
1757) had only made the thinly veiled antipathy more resolute.
Rousseau excused himself for wrongs of which in his heart he never
thought himself guilty. Grimm replied by a discourse on the virtues
of friendship and his own special aptitude for practising them. He
then conceded to the impetuous penitent the kiss of peace, in a
slight embrace which was like the accolade given by a monarch to
new knights.<a name="FNanchor308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308">[308]</a> The whole scene is ignoble. We seem to
be watching an unclean cauldron, with Theresa's mother, a cringing
and babbling crone, standing witch-like over it and infusing
suspicion, falsehood, and malice. When minds are thus surcharged,
any accident suffices to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.284" id="Page_i.284">[i.284]</a></span> release the evil creatures that lurk in an
irritated imagination.</p>
<p>One day towards the end of the autumn of 1757, Rousseau learned
to his unbounded surprise that Madame d'Epinay had been seized with
some strange disorder, which made it advisable that she should
start without any delay for Geneva, there to place herself under
the care of Tronchin, who was at that time the most famous doctor
in Europe. His surprise was greatly increased by the expectation
which he found among his friends that he would show his gratitude
for her many kindnesses to him, by offering to bear her company on
her journey, and during her stay in a town which was strange to her
and thoroughly familiar to him. It was to no purpose that he
protested how unfit was one invalid to be the nurse of another; and
how great an incumbrance a man would be in a coach in the bad
season, when for many days he was absolutely unable to leave his
chamber without danger. Diderot, with his usual eagerness to guide
a friend's course, wrote him a letter urging that his many
obligations, and even his grievances in respect of Madame d'Epinay,
bound him to accompany her, as he would thus repay the one and
console himself for the other. &quot;She is going into a country where
she will be like one fallen from the clouds. She is ill; she will
need amusement and distraction. As for winter, are you worse now
than you were a month back, or than you will be at the opening of
the spring? For me, I confess that if I could not bear the coach, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.285" id="Page_i.285">[i.285]</a></span>
would take a staff and follow her on foot.&quot;<a name="FNanchor309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309">[309]</a> Rousseau
trembled with fury, and as soon as the transport was over, he wrote
an indignant reply, in which he more or less politely bade the
panurgic one to attend to his own affairs, and hinted that Grimm
was making a tool of him. Next he wrote to Grimm himself a letter,
not unfriendly in form, asking his advice and promising to follow
it, but hardly hiding his resentment. By this time he had found out
the secret of Madame d'Epinay's supposed illness and her anxiety to
pass some months away from her family, and the share which Grimm
had in it. This, however, does not make many passages of his letter
any the less ungracious or unseemly. &quot;If Madame d'Epinay has shown
friend' ship to me, I have shown more to her.... As for benefits,
first of all I do not like them, I do not want them, and I owe no
thanks for any that people may burden me with by force. Madame
d'Epinay, being so often left alone in the country, wished me for
company; it was for that she had kept me. After making one
sacrifice to friendship, I must now make another to gratitude. A
man must be poor, must be without a servant, must be a hater of
constraint, and he must have my character, before he can know what
it is for me to live in another person's house. For all that, I
lived two years in hers, constantly brought into bondage with the
finest harangues about liberty, served by twenty domestics, and
cleaning my own shoes every morning, overloaded with gloomy
indigestion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.286" id="Page_i.286">[i.286]</a></span> incessantly sighing for my homely porringer....
Consider how much money an hour of the life and the time of a man
is worth; compare the kindnesses of Madame d'Epinay with the
sacrifice of my native country and two years of serfdom; and then
tell me whether the obligation is greater on her side or mine.&quot; He
then urges with a torrent of impetuous eloquence the thoroughly
sound reasons why it was unfair and absurd for him, a beggar and an
invalid, to make the journey with Madame d'Epinay, rich and
surrounded by attendants. He is particularly splenetic that the
philosopher Diderot, sitting in his own room before a good fire and
wrapped in a well-lined dressing-gown, should insist on his doing
his five and twenty leagues a day on foot, through the mud in
winter.<a name="FNanchor310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310">[310]</a></p>
<p>The whole letter shows, as so many incidents in his later life
showed, how difficult it was to do Rousseau a kindness with
impunity, and how little such friends as Madame d'Epinay possessed
the art of soothing this unfortunate nature. They fretted him by
not leaving him sufficiently free to follow his own changing moods,
while he in turn lost all self-control, and yielded in hours of
bodily torment to angry and resentful fancies. But let us hasten to
an end. Grimm replied to his eloquent manifesto somewhat drily, to
the effect that he would think the matter over, and that meanwhile
Rousseau had best keep quiet in his hermitage. Rousseau burning
with excitement at once conceived a thousand suspicions, wholly
unable to understand that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.287" id="Page_i.287">[i.287]</a></span> a cold and reserved German might choose
to deliberate at length, and finally give an answer with brevity.
&quot;After centuries of expectation in the cruel uncertainty in which
this barbarous man had plunged me&quot;&#8212;that is after eight or ten
days, the answer came, apparently not without a second direct
application for one.<a name="FNanchor311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311">[311]</a> It was short and extremely pointed, not
complaining that Rousseau had refused to accompany Madame d'Epinay
but protesting against the horrible tone of the apology which he
had sent to him for not accompanying her. &quot;It has made me quiver
with indignation; so odious are the principles it contains, so full
is it of blackness and duplicity. You venture to talk to me of your
slavery, to me who for more than two years have been the daily
witness of all the marks of the tenderest and most generous
friendship that you have received at the hands of that woman. If I
could pardon you, I should think myself unworthy of having a single
friend. I will never see you again while I live, and I shall think
myself happy if I can banish the recollection of your conduct from
my mind.&quot;<a name="FNanchor312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312">[312]</a> A flash of manly anger like this is
very welcome to us, who have to thread a tedious way between morbid
egoistic irritation on the one hand, and sly pieces of equivocal
complaisance on the other. The effect on Rousseau was terrific. In
a paroxysm he sent Grimm's letter back to him, with three or four
lines in the same key. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.288" id="Page_i.288">[i.288]</a></span> wrote note after note to Madame
d'Houdetot, in shrieks. &quot;Have I a single friend left, man or woman?
One word, only one word, and I can live.&quot; A day or two later:
&quot;Think of the state I am in. I can bear to be abandoned by all the
world, but you! You who know me so well! Great God! am I a
scoundrel? a scoundrel, I!&quot;<a name="FNanchor313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313">[313]</a> And so on, raving. It was to no purpose
that Madame d'Houdetot wrote him soothing letters, praying him to
calm himself, to find something to busy himself with, to remain at
peace with Madame d'Epinay, &quot;who had never appeared other than the
most thoughtful and warm-hearted friend to him.&quot;<a name="FNanchor314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314">[314]</a> He was almost
ready to quarrel with Madame d'Houdetot herself because she paid
the postage of her letters, which he counted an affront to his
poverty.<a name="FNanchor315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315">[315]</a>
To Madame d'Epinay he had written in the midst of his tormenting
uncertainty as to the answer which Grimm would make to his letter.
It was an ungainly assertion that she was playing a game of tyranny
and intrigue at his cost. For the first time she replied with
spirit and warmth. &quot;Your letter is hardly that of a man who, on the
eve of my departure, swore to me that he could never in his life
repair the wrongs he had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.289" id="Page_i.289">[i.289]</a></span> me.&quot; She then tersely remarks that it
is not natural to pass one's life in suspecting and insulting one's
friends, and that he abuses her patience. To this he answered with
still greater terseness that friendship was extinct between them,
and that he meant to leave the Hermitage, but as his friends
desired him to remain there until the spring he would with her
permission follow their counsel. Then she, with a final thrust of
impatience, in which we perhaps see the hand of Grimm: &quot;Since you
meant to leave the Hermitage, and felt you ought to do so, I am
astonished that your friends could detain you. For me, I don't
consult mine as to my duties, and I have nothing more to say to you
as to yours.&quot; This was the end. Rousseau returned for a moment from
ignoble petulance to dignity and self-respect. He wrote to her that
if it is a misfortune to make a mistake in the choice of friends,
it is one not less cruel to awake from so sweet an error, and two
days before he wrote, he left her house. He found a cottage at
Montmorency, and thither, nerved with fury, through snow and ice he
carried his scanty household goods (Dec. 15, 1757).<a name="FNanchor316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316">[316]</a></p>
<p>We have a picture of him in this fatal month. Diderot went to
pay him a visit (Dec. 5). Rousseau was alone at the bottom of his
garden. As soon as he saw Diderot, he cried in a voice of thunder
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.290" id="Page_i.290">[i.290]</a></span> with his eyes all aflame: &quot;What have you come here for?&quot; &quot;I
want to know whether you are mad or malicious.&quot; &quot;You have known me
for fifteen years; you are well aware how little malicious I am,
and I will prove to you that I am not mad: follow me.&quot; He then drew
Diderot into a room, and proceeded to clear himself, by means of
letters, of the charge of trying to make a breach between Saint
Lambert and Madame d'Houdetot. They were in fact letters that
convicted him, as we know, of trying to persuade Madame d'Houdetot
of the criminality of her relations with her lover, and at the same
time to accept himself in the very same relation. Of all this we
have heard more than enough already. He was stubborn in the face of
Diderot's remonstrance, and the latter left him in a state which he
described in a letter to Grimm the same night. &quot;I throw myself into
your arms, like one who has had a shock of fright: that man
intrudes into my work; he fills me with trouble, and I am as if I
had a damned soul at my side. May I never see him again; he would
make me believe in devils and hell.&quot;<a name="FNanchor317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317">[317]</a> And thus the
unhappy man who had began this episode in his life with confident
ecstasy in the glories and clear music of spring, ended it looking
out from a narrow chamber upon the sullen crimson of the wintry
twilight and over fields silent in snow, with the haggard desperate
gaze of a lost spirit.</p>

Madame d'Houdetot, (<i>b.</i> 1730&#8212;<i>d.</i> 1813) was the
daughter of M. de Bellegarde, the father of Madame d'Epinay's
husband. Her marriage with the Count d'Houdetot, of high Norman
stock, took place in 1748. The circumstances of the marriage, which
help to explain the lax view of the vows common among the great
people of the time, are given with perhaps a shade too much
dramatic colouring in Madame d'Epinay's <i>M&#233;m.</i>, i

the scene of reconciliation, but the nature of her relations with
him would account for this. The same circumstance, as M. Girardin
has pointed out (<i>Rev. des Deux Mondes</i>, Sept. 1853), would
explain the discrepancy between her letters as given in the
Confessions, and the copies of them sent to Grimm, and printed in
her Memoirs. M. Sainte Beuve, who is never perfectly master of
himself in dealing with the chiefs of the revolutionary schools, as
might indeed have been expected in a writer with his predilections
for the seventeenth century, rashly hints (<i>Causeries</i>, vii.
301) that Rousseau was the falsifier. The publication from the
autograph originals sets this at rest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII."></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>MUSIC.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Simplification</span> has already been used by us as the key-word to
Rousseau's aims and influence. The scheme of musical notation with
which he came to try his fortune in Paris in 1741, his published
vindication of it, and his musical compositions afterwards all fall
under this term. Each of them was a plea for the extrication of the
simple from the cumbrousness of elaborated pedantry, and for a
return to nature from the unmeaning devices of false art. And all
tended alike in the popular direction, towards the extension of
enjoyment among the common people, and the glorification of their
simple lives and moods, in the art designed for the great.</p>
<p>The Village Soothsayer was one of the group of works which
marked a revolution in the history of French music, by putting an
end to the tyrannical tradition of Lulli and Rameau, and preparing
the way through a middle stage of freshness, simplicity,
naturalism, up to the noble severity of Gluck (1714-1787). This
great composer, though a Bohemian by birth, found his first
appreciation in a public that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.292" id="Page_i.292">[i.292]</a></span> had been trained by the Italian
pastoral operas, of which Rousseau's was one of the earliest
produced in France. Gr&#233;tri, the Fleming (1741-1813), who had
a hearty admiration for Jean Jacques, and out of a sentiment of
piety lived for a time in his Hermitage, came in point of musical
excellence between the group of Rousseau, Philidor, Duni, and the
rest, and Gluck. &quot;I have not produced exaltation in people's heads
by tragical superlative,&quot; Gr&#233;tri said, &quot;but I have revealed
the accent of truth, which I have impressed deeper in men's
hearts.&quot;<a name="FNanchor318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318">[318]</a>
These words express sufficiently the kind of influence which
Rousseau also had. Crude as the music sounds to us who are
accustomed to more sumptuous schools, we can still hear in it the
note which would strike a generation weary of Rameau. It was the
expression in one way of the same mood which in another way
revolted against paint, false hair, and preposterous costume as of
savages grown opulent. Such music seems without passion or subtlety
or depth or magnificence. Thus it had hardly any higher than a
negative merit, but it was the necessary preparation for the
acceptance of a more positive style, that should replace both the
elaborate false art of the older French composers and the too
colourless realism of the pastoral comic opera, by the austere
loveliness and elevation of <i>Orfeo</i> and <i>Alceste</i>.</p>
<p>In 1752 an Italian company visited Paris, and performed at the
Opera a number of pieces by Pergolese, and other composers of their
country. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.293" id="Page_i.293">[i.293]</a></span> violent war arose, which agitated Paris far more
intensely than the defeat of Rossbach and the loss of Canada did
afterwards. The quarrel between the Parliament and the Clergy was
at its height. The Parliament had just been exiled, and the gravest
confusion threatened the State. The operatic quarrel turned the
excitement of the capital into another channel. Things went so far
that the censor was entreated to prohibit the printing of any work
containing the damnable doctrine and position that Italian music is
good. Rousseau took part enthusiastically with the Italians.<a name="FNanchor319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319">[319]</a> His Letter on
French Music (1753) proved to the great fury of the people
concerned, that the French had no national music, and that it would
be so much the worse for them if they ever had any. Their language,
so proper to be the organ of truth and reason, was radically unfit
either for poetry or music. All national music must derive its
principal characteristics from the language. Now if there is a
language in Europe fit for music, it is certainly the Italian, for
it is sweet, sonorous, harmonious, and more accentuated than any
other, and these are precisely the four qualities which adapt a
language to singing. It is sweet because the articulations are not
composite, because the meeting of consonants is both infrequent and
soft, and because a great number of the syllables being only formed
of vowels, frequent elisions make its pronunciation more flowing.
It is sonorous because most of the vowels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.294" id="Page_i.294">[i.294]</a></span> are full, because it is
without composite diphthongs, because it has few or no nasal
vowels. Again, the inversions of the Italian are far more
favourable to true melody than the didactic order of French. And so
onwards, with much close grappling of the matter. French melody
does not exist; it is only a sort of modulated plain-song which has
nothing agreeable in itself, which only pleases with the aid of a
few capricious ornaments, and then only pleases those who have
agreed to find it beautiful.<a name="FNanchor320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320">[320]</a></p>
<p>The letter contains a variety of acute remarks upon music, and
includes a vigorous protest against fugues, imitations, double
designs, and the like. Scarcely any one succeeds in them, and
success even when obtained hardly rewards the labour. As for
counterfugues, double fugues, and &quot;other difficult fooleries that
the ear cannot endure nor the reason justify,&quot; they are evidently
relics of barbarism and bad taste which only remain, like the
porticoes of our gothic churches, to the disgrace of those who had
patience enough to construct them.<a name="FNanchor321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321">[321]</a> The last phrase-and both Voltaire and
Turgot used gothic architecture as the symbol for the supreme of
rudeness and barbarism&#8212;shows that even a man who seems to run
counter to the whole current of his time yet does not escape its
influence.</p>
<p>Grimm, after remarking on the singularity of a demonstration of
the impossibility of setting melody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.295" id="Page_i.295">[i.295]</a></span> to French words on the part of
a writer who had just produced the Village Soothsayer, informs us
that the letter created a furious uproar, and set all Paris in a
blaze. He had himself taken the side of the Italians in an amusing
piece of pleasantry, which became a sort of classic model for
similar facetiousness in other controversies of the century. The
French, as he said, forgive everything in favour of what makes them
laugh, but Rousseau talked reason and demolished the pretensions of
French music with great sounding strokes as of an axe.<a name="FNanchor322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322">[322]</a> Rousseau
expected to be assassinated, and gravely assures us that there was
a plot to that effect, as well as a design to put him in the
Bastille. This we may fairly surmise to have been a fiction of his
own imagination, and the only real punishment that overtook him was
the loss of his right to free admission to the Opera. After what he
had said of the intolerable horrors of French music, the directors
of the theatre can hardly be accused of vindictiveness in releasing
him from them.<a name="FNanchor323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323">[323]</a> Some twenty years after (1774), when
Paris was torn asunder by the violence of the two great factions of
the Gluckists and Piccinists, Rousseau retracted his opinion as to
the impossibility of wedding melody to French words.<a name="FNanchor324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324">[324]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.296" id="Page_i.296">[i.296]</a></span> He went as
often as he could to hear the works both of Gr&#233;tri and
Gluck, and <i>Orfeo</i> delighted him, while the <i>Fausse
magie</i> of the former moved him to say to the composer, &quot;Your
music stirs sweet sensations to which I thought my heart had long
been closed.&quot;<a name="FNanchor325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325">[325]</a> This being so, and life being as brief
as art is long, we need not further examine the controversy. It may
be worth adding that Rousseau wrote some of the articles on music
for the Encyclop&#230;dia, and that in 1767 he published a not
inconsiderable Musical Dictionary of his own.</p>
<p>His scheme of a new musical notation and the principles on which
he defended it are worth attention, because some of the ideas are
now accepted as the base of a well-known and growing system of
musical instruction. The aim of the scheme, let us say to begin
with, was at once practical and popular; to reduce the difficulty
of learning music to the lowest possible point, and so to bring the
most delightful of the arts within the reach of the largest
possible number of people. Hence, although he maintains the fitness
of his scheme for instrumental as well as vocal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.297" id="Page_i.297">[i.297]</a></span> performances, it is
clearly the latter which he has most at heart, evidently for the
reason that this is the kind of music most accessible to the
thousands, and it was always the thousands of whom Rousseau
thought. This is the true distinction of music, it is for the
people; and the best musical notation is that which best enables
persons to sing at sight. The difficulty of the old notation had
come practically before him as a teacher. The quantity of details
which the pupil was forced to commit to memory before being able to
sing from the open book, struck him then as the chief obstacle to
anything like facility in performance, and without some of this
facility he rightly felt that music must remain a luxury for the
few. So genuine was his interest in the matter, that he was not
very careful to fight for the originality of his own scheme. Our
present musical signs, he said, are so imperfect and so
inconvenient that it is no wonder that several persons have tried
to re-cast or amend them; nor is it any wonder that some of them
should have hit upon the same device in selecting the signs most
natural and proper, such as numerical figures. As much, however,
depends on the way of dealing with these figures, as with their
adoption, and here he submitted that his own plan was as novel as
it was advantageous.<a name="FNanchor326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326">[326]</a> Thus we have to bear in mind that
Rousseau's scheme was above all things a practical device,
contrived for making the teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.298" id="Page_i.298">[i.298]</a></span>ing and the learning of musical
elements an easier process.<a name="FNanchor327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327">[327]</a></p>
<p>The chief element of the project consists in the substitution of
a relative series of notes or symbols in place of an absolute
series. In the common notation any given note, say the A of the
treble clef, is uniformly represented by the same symbol, namely,
the position of second space in the clef, whatever key it may
belong to. Rousseau, insisting on the varying quality impressed on
any tone of a given pitch by the key-note of the scale to which it
belongs, protested against the same name being given to the tone,
however the quality of it might vary. Thus Re or D, which is the
second tone in the key of C, ought, according to him, to have a
different name when found as the fifth in the key of G, and in
every case the name should at once indicate the interval of a tone
from its key-note. His mode of effecting this change is as follows.
The names <i>ut, re</i>, and the rest, are kept for the fixed order
of the tones, C, D, E, and the rest. The key of a piece is shown by
prefixing one of these symbols, and this determines the absolute
quality of the melody as to pitch. That settled, every tone is
expressed by a number bearing a relation to the key-note. This
tonic note is represented by one, the other six tones of the scale
are expressed by the numbers from two to seven. In the popular
Tonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.299" id="Page_i.299">[i.299]</a></span> Sol-Fa notation, which corresponds so closely to Rousseau's
in principle, the key-note is always styled Do, and the other
symbols, <i>mi</i>, <i>la</i>, and the rest, indicate at once the
relative position of these tones in their particular key or scale.
Here the old names were preserved as being easily sung; Rousseau
selected numbers because he supposed that they best expressed the
generation of the sounds.<a name="FNanchor328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328">[328]</a></p>
<p>Rousseau attempted to find a theoretic base for this symbolic
establishment of the relational quality of tones, and he dimly
guessed that the order of the harmonics or upper tones of a given
tonic would furnish a principle for forming the familiar major
scale,<a name="FNanchor329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329">[329]</a>
but his knowledge of the order was faulty. He was perhaps groping
after the idea by which Professor Helmholtz has accounted for the
various mental effects of the several intervals in a key&#8212;namely,
the degree of natural affinity, measured by means of the upper
tones, existing between the given tone and its tonic. Apart from
this, however, the practical value of his ideas in instruction in
singing is clearly shown by the circumstance that at any given time
many thousands of young children are now being taught to read
melody in the Sol-Fa notation in a few weeks. This shows how right
Rousseau was in continually declaring the ease of hitting a
particular tone, when the relative position of the tone in respect
to the key-note is clearly manifested. A singer in trying to hit
the tone is compelled to measure the interval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.300" id="Page_i.300">[i.300]</a></span> between it and the
preceding tone, and the simplest and easiest mode of doing this is
to associate every tone with the tonics, thus constituting it a
term of a relation with this fundamental tone.</p>
<p>Rousseau made a mistake when he supposed that his ideas were
just as applicable to instrumental as they were to vocal music. The
requirements of the singer are not those of the player. To a
performer on the piano, who has to light rapidly and simultaneously
on a number of tones, or to a violinist who has to leap through
several octaves with great rapidity, the most urgent need is that
of a definite and fixed mark, by which the absolute pitch of each
successive tone may be at once recognised. Neither of these has any
time to think about the melodious relation of the tones; it is
quite as much as they can do to find their place on the key-board
or the string. Rousseau's scheme, or any similar one, fails to
supply the clear and obvious index to pitch supplied by the old
system. Old Rameau pointed this out to Rousseau when the scheme was
laid before him, and Rousseau admitted that the objection was
decisive,<a name="FNanchor330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330">[330]</a> though his admission was not practically
deterrent.</p>
<p>His device for expressing change of octave by means of points
would render the rapid seizing of a particular tone by the
performer still more difficult, and it is strange that he should
have preferred this to the other plan suggested, of indicating
height of octave by visible place above or below a horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.301" id="Page_i.301">[i.301]</a></span> line.
Again, his attempt to simplify the many varieties of musical time
by reducing them all to the two modes of double and triple time,
though laudable enough, yet implies an imperfect recognition of the
full meaning of time, by omitting all reference to the distribution
of accent and to the average time value of the tones in a
particular movement.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX."></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>VOLTAIRE AND D'ALEMBERT.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> in the full tide of the eighteenth century had
something to do with Voltaire, from serious personages like
Frederick the Great and Turgot, down to the sorriest poetaster who
sent his verses to be corrected or bepraised. Rousseau's debt to
him in the days of his unformed youth we have already seen, as well
as the courtesies with which they approached one another, when
Richelieu employed the struggling musician to make some
modifications in the great man's unconsidered court-piece. Neither
of them then dreamed that their two names were destined to form the
great literary antithesis of the century. In the ten years that
elapsed between their first interchange of letters and their first
fit of coldness, it must have been tolerably clear to either of
them, if either of them gave thought to the matter, that their
dissidence was increasing and likely to increase. Their methods
were different, their training different, their points of view
different, and above all these things, their temperaments were
different by a whole heaven's breadth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.303" id="Page_i.303">[i.303]</a></span></p>

<p>A great number of excellent and pointed half-truths have been
uttered by various persons in illustration of all these contrasts.
The philosophy of Voltaire, for instance, is declared to be that of
the happy, while Rousseau is the philosopher of the unhappy.
Voltaire steals away their faith from those who doubt, while
Rousseau strikes doubt into the mind of the unbeliever. The gaiety
of the one saddens, while the sadness of the other consoles. If we
pass from the marked divergence in tendencies, which is imperfectly
hinted at in such sayings as these, to the divergence between them
in all the fundamental conditions of intellectual and moral life,
then the variation which divided the revolutionary stream into two
channels, flowing broadly apart through unlike regions and climates
down to the great sea, is intelligible enough. Voltaire was the
arch-representative of all those elements in contemporary thought,
its curiosity, irreverence, intrepidity, vivaciousness,
rationality, to which, as we have so often had to say, Rousseau's
temperament and his Genevese spirit made him profoundly
antipathetic. Voltaire was the great high priest, robed in the
dazzling vestments of poetry and philosophy and history, of that
very religion of knowledge and art which Rousseau declared to be
the destroyer of the felicity of men. The glitter has faded away
from Voltaire's philosophic raiment since those days, and his
laurel bough lies a little leafless. Still this can never make us
forget that he was in his day and generation one of the sovereign
emancipators, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.304" id="Page_i.304">[i.304]</a></span> he awoke one dormant set of energies, just as
Rousseau presently came to awake another set. Each was a power, not
merely by virtue of some singular preeminence of understanding or
mysterious unshared insight of his own, but for a far deeper
reason. No partial and one-sided direction can permanently satisfy
the manifold aspirations and faculties of the human mind in the
great average of common men, and it is the common average of men to
whom exceptional thinkers speak, whom they influence, and by whom
they are in turn influenced, depressed, or buoyed up, just as a
painter or a dramatist is affected. Voltaire's mental constitution
made him eagerly objective, a seeker of true things, quivering for
action, admirably sympathetic with all life and movement, a spirit
restlessly traversing the whole world. Rousseau, far different from
this, saw in himself a reflected microcosm of the outer world, and
was content to take that instead of the outer world, and as its
truest version. He made his own moods the premisses from which he
deduced a system of life for humanity, and so far as humanity has
shared his moods or some parts of them, his system was true, and
has been accepted. To him the bustle of the outer world was only a
hindrance to that process of self-absorption which was his way of
interpreting life. Accessible only to interests of emotion and
sense, he was saved from intellectual sterility, and made eloquent,
by the vehemence of his emotion and the fire of his senses. He was
a master example of sensibility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.305" id="Page_i.305">[i.305]</a></span> as Voltaire was a master example
of clear-eyed penetration.</p>
<p>This must not be taken for a rigid piece of mutually exclusive
division, for the edges of character are not cut exactly sharp, as
words are. Especially when any type is intense, it seems to meet
and touch its opposite. Just as Voltaire's piercing activity and
soundness of intelligence made him one of the humanest of men, so
Rousseau's emotional susceptibility endowed him with the gift of a
vision that carried far into the social depths. It was a very early
criticism on the pair, that Voltaire wrote on more subjects, but
that Rousseau was the more profound. In truth one was hardly much
more profound than the other. Rousseau had the sonorousness of
speech which popular confusion of thought is apt to identify with
depth. And he had seriousness. If profundity means the quality of
seeing to the heart of subjects, Rousseau had in a general way
rather less of it than the shrewd-witted crusher of the Infamous.
What the distinction really amounts to is that Rousseau had a
strong feeling for certain very important aspects of human life,
which Voltaire thought very little about, or never thought about at
all, and that while Voltaire was concerned with poetry, history,
literature, and the more ridiculous parts of the religious
superstition of his time, Rousseau thought about social justice and
duty and God and the spiritual consciousness of men, with a certain
attempt at thoroughness and system. As for the substance of his
thinking, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.306" id="Page_i.306">[i.306]</a></span> already seen in the Discourses, and shall soon
have an opportunity of seeing still more clearly, it was often as
thin and hollow as if he had belonged to the company of the
epigrammatical, who, after all, have far less of a monopoly of
shallow thinking than is often supposed. The prime merit of
Rousseau, in comparing him with the brilliant chief of the
rationalistic school of the time, is his reverence; reverence for
moral worth in however obscure intellectual company, for the
dignity of human character and the loftiness of duty, for some of
those cravings of the human mind after the divine and
incommensurable, which may indeed often be content with solutions
proved by long time and slow experience to be inadequate, but which
are closely bound up with the highest elements of nobleness of
soul.</p>
<p>It was this spiritual part of him which made Rousseau a third
great power in the century, between the Encyclop&#230;dic party
and the Church. He recognised a something in men, which the
Encyclop&#230;dists treated as a chimera imposed on the
imagination by theologians and others for their own purposes. And
he recognised this in a way which did not offend the rational
feeling of the times, as the Catholic dogmas offended it. In a word
he was religious. In being so, he separated himself from Voltaire
and his school, who did passably well without religion. Again, he
was a puritan. In being this, he was cut off from the
intellectually and morally unreformed church, which was then the
organ of religion in France. Nor is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.307" id="Page_i.307">[i.307]</a></span> all. It was Rousseau, and
not the feeble controversialists put up from time to time by the
Jesuits and other ecclesiastical bodies, who proved the effective
champion of religion, and the only power who could make head
against the triumphant onslaught of the Voltaireans. He gave up
Christian dogmas and mysteries, and, throwing himself with
irresistible ardour upon the emotions in which all religions have
their root and their power, he breathed new life into them, he
quickened in men a strong desire to have them satisfied, and he
beat back the army of emancipators with the loud and incessantly
repeated cry that they were not come to deliver the human mind, but
to root out all its most glorious and consolatory attributes. This
immense achievement accomplished,&#8212;the great framework of a faith
in God and immortality and providential government of the world
thus preserved, it was an easy thing by and by for the churchmen to
come back, and once more unpack and restore to their old places the
temporarily discredited paraphernalia of dogma and mystery. How far
all this was good or bad for the mental elevation of France and
Europe, we shall have a better opportunity of considering
presently.</p>
<p>We have now only to glance at the first skirmishes between the
religious reactionist, on the one side, and, on the other, the
leader of the school who believed that men are better employed in
thinking as accurately, and knowing as widely, and living as
humanely, as all those difficult processes are possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.308" id="Page_i.308">[i.308]</a></span> than in
wearying themselves in futile search after gods who dwell on
inaccessible heights.</p>

<p>Voltaire had acknowledged Rousseau's gift of the second
Discourse with his usual shrewd pleasantry: &quot;I have received your
new book against the human race, and thank you for it. Never was
such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. One
longs in reading your book to walk on all fours. But as I have lost
that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the
impossibility of resuming it. Nor can I embark in search of the
savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned
render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on
in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made
the savages nearly as bad as ourselves. So I content myself with
being a very peaceable savage in the solitude which I have chosen
near your native place, where you ought to be too.&quot; After an
extremely inadequate discussion of one or two points in the
essay,<a name="FNanchor331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331">[331]</a>
he concludes:&#8212;&quot;I am informed that your health is bad; you ought to
come to set it up again in your native air, to enjoy freedom, to
drink with me the milk of our cows and browse our grass.&quot;<a name="FNanchor332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332">[332]</a> Rousseau
replied to all this in a friendly way, recognising Voltaire as his
chief, and actually at the very moment when he tells us that the
corrupting presence of the arrogant and seductive man at Geneva
helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.309" id="Page_i.309">[i.309]</a></span> to make the idea of returning to Geneva odious to him,
hailing him in such terms as these:&#8212;&quot;Sensible of the honour you do
my country, I share the gratitude of my fellow-citizens, and hope
that it will increase when they have profited by the lessons that
you of all men are able to give them. Embellish the asylum you have
chosen; enlighten a people worthy of your instruction; and do you
who know so well how to paint virtue and freedom, teach us to
cherish them in our walls.&quot;<a name="FNanchor333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333">[333]</a></p>
<p>Within a year, however, the bright sky became a little clouded.
In 1756 Voltaire published one of the most sincere, energetic, and
passionate pieces to be found in the whole literature of the
eighteenth century, his poem on the great earthquake of Lisbon
(November 1755). No such word had been heard in Europe since the
terrible images in which Pascal had figured the doom of man. It was
the reaction of one who had begun life by refuting Pascal with
doctrines of cheerfulness drawn from the optimism of Pope and
Leibnitz, who had done Pope's Essay on Man (1732-34) into French
verse as late as 1751,<a name="FNanchor334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334">[334]</a> and whose imagination, already sombred
by the triumphant cruelty and superstition which raged around him,
was suddenly struck with horror by a catastrophe which, in a world
where whatever is is best, destroyed hundreds of human creatures in
the smoking ashes and engulfed wreck of their city. How, he cried,
can you persist in talking of the deliberate will of a free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.310" id="Page_i.310">[i.310]</a></span> and
benevolent God, whose eternal laws necessitated such an appalling
climax of misery and injustice as this? Was the disaster
retributive? If so, why is Lisbon in ashes, while Paris dances? The
enigma is desperate and inscrutable, and the optimist lives in the
paradise of the fool. We ask in vain what we are, where we are,
whither we go, whence we came. We are tormented atoms on a clod of
earth, whom death at last swallows up, and with whom destiny
meanwhile makes cruel sport. The past is only a disheartening
memory, and if the tomb destroys the thinking creature, how
frightful is the present!</p>
<p>Whatever else we may say of Voltaire's poem, it was at least the
first sign of the coming reaction of sympathetic imagination
against the polished common sense of the great Queen Anne school,
which had for more than a quarter of a century such influence in
Europe.<a name="FNanchor335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335">[335]</a>
It is a little odd that Voltaire, the most brilliant and versatile
branch of this stock, should have broken so energetically away from
it, and that he should have done so, shows how open and how strong
was the feeling in him for reality and actual circumstance.</p>
<p>Rousseau was amazed that a man overwhelmed as Voltaire was with
prosperity and glory, should declaim against the miseries of this
life and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.311" id="Page_i.311">[i.311]</a></span>nounce that all is evil and vanity. &quot;Voltaire in
seeming always to believe in God, never really believed in anybody
but the devil, since his pretended God is a maleficent being who
according to him finds all his pleasure in working mischief. The
absurdity of this doctrine is especially revolting in a man crowned
with good things of every sort, and who from the midst of his own
happiness tries to fill his fellow-creatures with despair, by the
cruel and terrible image of the serious calamities from which he is
himself free.&quot;<a name="FNanchor336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336">[336]</a></p>
<p>As if any doctrine could be more revolting than this which
Rousseau so quietly takes for granted, that if it is well with me
and I am free from calamities, then there must needs be a
beneficent ruler of the universe, and the calamities of all the
rest of the world, if by chance they catch the fortunate man's eye,
count for nothing in our estimate of the method of the supposed
divine government. It is hard to imagine a more execrable emotion
than the complacent religiosity of the prosperous. Voltaire is more
admirable in nothing than in the ardent humanity and far-spreading
lively sympathy with which he interested himself in all the world's
fortunes, and felt the catastrophe of Lisbon as profoundly as if
the Geneva at his gates had been destroyed. He relished his own
prosperity keenly enough, but his prosperity became ashes in his
mouth when he heard of distress or wrong, and he did not rest until
he had moved heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.312" id="Page_i.312">[i.312]</a></span> and earth to soothe the distress and repair the
wrong. It was his impatience in the face of the evils of the time
which wrung from him this desperate cry, and it is precisely
because these evils did not touch him in his own person, that he
merits the greater honour for the surpassing energy and sincerity
of his feeling for them.</p>
<p>Rousseau, however, whose biographer has no such stories to tell
as those of Calas and La Barre, Sirven and Lally, but only tales of
a maiden wrongfully accused of theft, and a friend left senseless
on the pavement of a strange town, and a benefactress abandoned to
the cruelty of her fate, still was moved in the midst of his erotic
visions in the forest of Montmorency to speak a jealous word in
vindication of the divine government of our world. For him at any
rate life was then warm and the day bright and the earth very fair,
and he lauded his gods accordingly. It was his very sensuousness,
as we are so often saying, that made him religious. The optimism
which Voltaire wished to destroy was to him a sovereign element of
comfort. &quot;Pope's poem,&quot; he says, &quot;softens my misfortunes and
inclines me to patience, while yours sharpens all my pains, excites
me to murmuring, and reduces me to despair. Pope and Leibnitz
exhort me to resignation by declaring calamities to be a necessary
effect of the nature and constitution of the universe. You cry,
Suffer for ever, unhappy wretch; if there be a God who created
thee, he could have stayed thy pains if he would: hope for no end
to them, for there is no reason to be discerned for thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.313" id="Page_i.313">[i.313]</a></span> existence,
except to suffer and to perish.&quot;<a name="FNanchor337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337">[337]</a> Rousseau then proceeds to argue the
matter, but he says nothing really to the point which Pope had not
said before, and said far more effectively. He begins, however,
originally enough by a triumphant reference to his own great theme
of the superiority of the natural over the civil state. Moral evil
is our own work, the result of our liberty; so are most of our
physical evils, except death, and that is mostly an evil only from
the preparations that we make for it. Take the case of Lisbon. Was
it nature who collected the twenty thousand houses, all seven
stories high? If the people of Lisbon had been dispersed over the
face of the country, as wild tribes are, they would have fled at
the first shock, and they would have been seen the next day twenty
leagues away, as gay as if nothing had happened. And how many of
them perished in the attempt to rescue clothes or papers or money?
Is it not true that the person of a man is now, thanks to
civilisation, the least part of himself, and is hardly worth saving
after loss of the rest? Again, there are some events which lose
much of their horror when we look at them closely. A premature
death is not always a real evil and may be a relative good; of the
people crushed to death under the ruins of Lisbon, many no doubt
thus escaped still worse calamities. And is it worse to be killed
swiftly than to await death in prolonged anguish?<a name="FNanchor338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338">[338]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.314" id="Page_i.314">[i.314]</a></span></p>

<p>The good of the whole is to be sought before the good of the
part. Although the whole material universe ought not to be dearer
to its Creator than a single thinking and feeling being, yet the
system of the universe which produces, preserves, and perpetuates
all thinking and feeling beings, ought to be dearer to him than any
one of them, and he may, notwithstanding his goodness, or rather by
reason of his goodness, sacrifice something of the happiness of
individuals to the preservation of the whole. &quot;That the dead body
of a man should feed worms or wolves or plants is not, I admit, a
compensation for the death of such a man; but if in the system of
this universe, it is necessary for the preservation of the human
race that there should be a circulation of substance between men,
animals, vegetables, then the particular mishap of an individual
contributes to the general good. I die, I am eaten by worms; but my
children, my brothers, will live as I have lived; my body enriches
the earth of which they will consume the fruits; and so I do, by
the order of nature and for all men, what Codrus, Curtius, the
Decii, and a thousand others, did of their own free will for a
small part of men.&quot; (p. 305.)</p>
<p>All this is no doubt very well said, and we are bound to accept
it as true doctrine. Although, however, it may make resignation
easier by explaining the nature of evil, it does not touch the
point of Voltaire's outburst, which is that evil exists, and exists
in shapes which it is a mere mockery to associate with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.315" id="Page_i.315">[i.315]</a></span> the
omnipotence of a benevolent controller of the world's forces.
According to Rousseau, if we go to the root of what he means, there
is no such thing as evil, though much that to our narrow and
impatient sight has the look of it. This may be true if we use that
fatal word in an arbitrary and unreal sense, for the avoidable, the
consequent without antecedent, or antecedent without consequent. If
we consent to talk in this way, and only are careful to define
terms so that there is no doubt as to their meaning, it is hardly
deniable that evil is a mere word and not a reality, and whatever
is is indeed right and best, because no better is within our reach.
Voltaire, however, like the man of sense that he was, exclaimed
that at any rate relatively to us poor creatures the existence of
pain, suffering, waste, whether caused or uncaused, whether in
accordance with stern immutable law or mere divine caprice, is a
most indisputable reality: from our point of view it is a cruel
puerility to cry out at every calamity and every iniquity that all
is well in the best of possible worlds, and to sing hymns of praise
and glory to the goodness and mercy of a being of supreme might,
who planted us in this evil state and keeps us in it. Voltaire's is
no perfect philosophy; indeed it is not a philosophy at all, but a
passionate ejaculation; but it is perfect in comparison with a cut
and dried system like this of Rousseau's, which rests on a mocking
juggle with phrases, and the substitution by dexterous sleight of
hand of one definition for another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.316" id="Page_i.316">[i.316]</a></span></p>

<p>Rousseau really gives up the battle, by confessing frankly that
the matter is beyond the light of reason, and that, &quot;if the theist
only founds his sentiment on probabilities, the atheist with still
less precision only founds his on the alternative possibilities.&quot;
The objections on both sides are insoluble, because they turn on
things of which men can have no veritable idea; &quot;yet I believe in
God as strongly as I believe any other truth, because believing and
not believing are the last things in the world that depend on me.&quot;
So be it. But why take the trouble to argue in favour of one side
of an avowedly insoluble question? It was precisely because he felt
that the objections on both sides cannot be answered, that
Voltaire, hastily or not, cried out that he faced the horrors of
such a catastrophe as the Lisbon earthquake without a glimpse of
consolation. The upshot of Rousseau's remonstrance only amounted to
this, that he could not furnish one with any consolation out of the
armoury of reason, that he himself found this consolation, but in a
way that did not at all depend upon his own effort or will, and was
therefore as incommunicable as the advantage of having a large
appetite or being six feet high. The reader of Rousseau becomes
accustomed to this way of dealing with subjects of discussion. We
see him using his reason as adroitly as he knows how for
three-fourths of the debate, and then he suddenly flings himself
back with a triumphant kind of weariness into the buoyant waters of
emotion and sentiment. &quot;You sir, who are a poet,&quot; once said Madame
d'Epinay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.317" id="Page_i.317">[i.317]</a></span> to Saint Lambert, &quot;will agree with me that the existence
of a Being, eternal, all powerful, and of sovereign intelligence,
is at any rate the germ of the finest enthusiasm.&quot;<a name="FNanchor339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339">[339]</a> To take this
position and cleave to it may be very well, but why spoil its
dignity and repose by an unmeaning and superfluous flourish of the
weapons of the reasoner?</p>
<p>With the same hasty change of direction Rousseau says the true
question is not whether each of us suffers or not, but whether it
is good that the universe should be, and whether our misfortunes
were inevitable in its constitution. Then within a dozen lines he
admits that there can be no direct proof either way; we must
content ourselves with settling it by means of inference from the
perfections of God. Of course, it is clear that in the first place
what Rousseau calls the true question consists of two quite
distinct questions. Is the universe in its present ordering on the
whole good relatively either to men, or to all sentient creatures?
Next was evil an inevitable element in that ordering? Second, this
way of putting it does not in the least advance the case against
Voltaire, who insisted that no fine phrases ought to hide from us
the dreadful power and crushing reality of evil and the desolate
plight in which we are left. This is no exhaustive thought, but a
deep cry of anguish at the dark lot of men, and of just indignation
against the philosophy which to creatures asking for bread gave the
brightly polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.318" id="Page_i.318">[i.318]</a></span> stone of sentimental theism. Rousseau urged that
Voltaire robbed men of their only solace. What Voltaire really did
urge was that the solace derived from the attribution of humanity
and justice to the Supreme Being, and from the metaphysical account
of evil, rests on too narrow a base either to cover the facts, or
to be a true solace to any man who thinks and observes. He ought to
have gone on, if it had only been possible in those times, to
persuade his readers that there is no solace attainable, except
that of an energetic fortitude, and that we do best to go into life
not in a softly lined silken robe, but with a sharp sword and
armour thrice tempered. As between himself and Rousseau, he saw
much the more keenly of the two, and this was because he approached
the matter from the side of the facts, while the latter approached
it from the side of his own mental comfort and the preconceptions
involved in it.</p>
<p>The most curious part of this curious letter is the conclusion,
where Rousseau, loosely wandering from his theme, separates
Voltaire from the philosopher, and beseeches him to draw up a moral
code or profession of civil faith that should contain positively
the social maxims that everybody should be bound to admit, and
negatively the intolerant maxims that everybody should be forced to
reject as seditious. Every religion in accord with the code should
be allowed, and every religion out of accord with it proscribed, or
a man might be free to have no other religion but the code
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.319" id="Page_i.319">[i.319]</a></span></p>

<p>Voltaire was much too clear-headed a person to take any notice
of nonsense like this. Rousseau's letter remained unanswered, nor
is there any reason to suppose that Voltaire ever got through it,
though Rousseau chose to think that <i>Candide</i> (1759) was meant
for a reply to him.<a name="FNanchor340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340">[340]</a> He is careful to tell us that he never
read that incomparable satire, for which one would be disposed to
pity any one except Rousseau, whose appreciation of wit, if not of
humour also, was probably more deficient than in any man who ever
lived, either in Geneva or any other country fashioned after
Genevan guise. Rousseau's next letter to Voltaire was four years
later, and by that time the alienation which had no definitely
avowed cause, and can be marked by no special date, had become
complete. &quot;I hate you, in fact,&quot; he concluded, &quot;since you have so
willed it; but I hate you like a man still worthier to have loved
you, if you had willed it. Of all the sentiments with which my
heart was full towards you, there only remains the admiration that
we cannot refuse to your fine genius, and love for your writings.
If there is nothing in you which I can honour but your talents,
that is no fault of mine.&quot;<a name="FNanchor341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341">[341]</a> We know that Voltaire did not take
reproach with serenity, and he behaved with bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.320" id="Page_i.320">[i.320]</a></span> violence towards
Rousseau in circumstances when silence would have been both more
magnanimous and more humane. Rousseau occasionally, though not very
often, retaliated in the same vein.<a name="FNanchor342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342">[342]</a> On the whole
his judgment of Voltaire, when calmly given, was not meant to be
unkind. &quot;Voltaire's first impulse,&quot; he said, &quot;is to be good; it is
reflection that makes him bad.&quot;<a name="FNanchor343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343">[343]</a> Tronchin had said in the same way that
Voltaire's heart was the dupe of his understanding. Rousseau is
always trying to like him, he always recognises him as the first
man of the time, and he subscribed his mite for the erection of a
statue to him. It was the satire and mockery in Voltaire which
irritated Rousseau more than the doctrines or denial of doctrine
which they cloaked; in his eyes sarcasm was always the veritable
dialect of the evil power. It says something for the sincerity of
his efforts after equitable judgment, that he should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.321" id="Page_i.321">[i.321]</a></span> had the
patience to discern some of the fundamental merit of the most
remorseless and effective mocker that ever made superstition look
mean, and its doctors ridiculous.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>Voltaire was indirectly connected with Rousseau's energetic
attack upon another great Encyclop&#230;dist leader, the famous
Letter to D'Alembert on Stage Plays. &quot;There,&quot; Rousseau said
afterwards, &quot;is my favourite book, my Benjamin, because I produced
it without effort, at the first inspiration, and in the most lucid
moments of my life.&quot;<a name="FNanchor344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344">[344]</a> Voltaire, who to us figures so little
as a poet and dramatist, was to himself and to his contemporaries
of this date a poet and dramatist before all else, the author of
<i>Za&#239;re</i> and <i>Mahomet</i>, rather than of <i>Candide</i>
and the <i>Philosophical Dictionary</i>. D'Alembert was Voltaire's
staunchest henchman. He only wrote his article on Geneva for the
Encyclop&#230;dia to gratify the master. Fresh from a visit to him
when he composed it, he took occasion to regret that the austerity
of the tradition of the city deprived it of the manifold advantages
of a theatre. This suggestion had its origin partly in a desire to
promote something that would please the eager vanity of the
dramatist whom Geneva now had for so close a neighbour, and who had
just set her the example by setting up a theatre of his own; and
partly, also, because it gave the writer an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.322" id="Page_i.322">[i.322]</a></span> of
denouncing the intolerant rigour with which the church nearer home
treated the stage and all who appeared on it. Geneva was to set an
example that could not be resisted, and France would no longer see
actors on the one hand pensioned by the government, and on the
other an object of anathema, excommunicated by priests and regarded
with contempt by citizens.<a name="FNanchor345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345">[345]</a></p>
<p>The inveterate hostility of the church to the theatre was
manifested by the French ecclesiastics in the full eighteenth
century as bitterly as ever. The circumstance that Voltaire was the
great play-writer of the time would not tend to soften their
traditional prejudice, and the persecution of players by priests
was in some sense an episode of the war between the priest and the
philosophers. The latter took up the cause of the stage partly
because they hoped to make the drama an effective rival to the
teaching of pulpit and confessional, partly from their natural
sympathy with an elevated form of intellectual manifestation, and
partly from their abhorrence of the practical inhumanity with which
the officers of the church treated stage performers. While people
of quality eagerly sought the society of those who furnished them
as much diversion in private as in public, the church refused to
all players the marriage blessing; when an actor or actress wished
to marry, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.323" id="Page_i.323">[i.323]</a></span> obliged to renounce the stage, and the
Archbishop of Paris diligently resisted evasion or
subterfuge.<a name="FNanchor346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346">[346]</a> The atrocities connected with the
refusal of burial, as well in the case of players as of
philosophers, are known to all readers in a dozen illustrious
instances, from Moli&#232;re and Adrienne Lecouvreur
downwards.</p>
<p>Here, as along the whole line of the battle between new light
and old prejudice, Rousseau took part, if not with the church, at
least against its adversaries. His point of view was at bottom
truly puritanical. Jeremy Collier in his <i>Short View of the
Profaneness and Immorality of the English Stage</i> (1698) takes up
quite a different position. This once famous piece was not a
treatment of the general question, but an attack on certain
specific qualities of the plays of his time&#8212;their indecency of
phrase, their oaths, their abuse of the clergy, the gross
libertinism of the characters. One can hardly deny that this was
richly deserved by the English drama of the Restoration, and
Collier's strictures were not applicable, nor meant to apply,
either to the ancients, for he has a good word even for
Aristophanes, or to the French drama. Bossuet's loftier
denunciation, like Rousseau's, was puritanical, and it extended to
the whole body of stage plays. He objected to the drama as a school
of concupiscence, as a subtle or gross debaucher of the gravity and
purity of the understanding, as essentially a charmer of the
senses, and therefore the most equivocal and untrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.324" id="Page_i.324">[i.324]</a></span>worthy of
teachers. He appeals to the fathers, to Scripture, to Plato, and
even to Christ, who cried, <i>Woe unto you that laugh</i>.<a name="FNanchor347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347">[347]</a> There is a
fine austerity about Bossuet's energetic criticism; it is so free
from breathless eagerness, and so severe without being thinly
bitter. The churchmen of a generation or two later had fallen from
this height into gloomy peevishness.</p>
<p>Rousseau's letter on the theatre, it need hardly be said, is
meant to be an appeal to the common sense and judgment of his
readers, and not conceived in the ecclesiastical tone of unctuous
anathema and fulgurant menace. It is no bishop's pastoral, replete
with solecisms of thought and idiom, but a piece of firm dialectic
in real matter. His position is this: that the moral effect of the
stage can never be salutary in itself, while it may easily be
extremely pernicious, and that the habit of frequenting the
theatre, the taste for imitating the style of the actors, the cost
in money, the waste in time, and all the other accessory
conditions, apart from the morality of the matter represented, are
bad things in themselves, absolutely and in every circumstance.
Secondly, these effects in all kinds are specially bad in relation
to the social condition and habits of Geneva.<a name="FNanchor348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348">[348]</a> The first part
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.325" id="Page_i.325">[i.325]</a></span> discussion is an ingenious answer to some of the now trite
pleas for the morality of the drama, such as that tragedy leads to
pity through terror, that comedy corrects men while amusing them,
that both make virtue attractive and vice hateful.<a name="FNanchor349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349">[349]</a> Rousseau
insists with abundance of acutely chosen illustration that the pity
that is awaked by tragedy is a fleeting emotion which subsides when
the curtain falls; that comedy as often as not amuses men at the
expense of old age, uncouth virtue, paternal carefulness, and other
objects which we should be taught rather to revere than to
ridicule; and that both tragedy and comedy, instead of making vice
hateful, constantly win our sympathy for it. Is not the French
stage, he asks, as much the triumph of great villains, like
Catilina, Mahomet, Atreus, as of illustrious heroes?</p>
<p>This rude handling of accepted commonplace is always one of the
most interesting features in Rousseau's polemic. It was of course a
characteristic of the eighteenth century always to take up the
ethical and high prudential view of whatever had to be justified,
and Rousseau seems from this point to have been successful in
demolishing arguments which might hold of Greek tragedy at its
best, but which certainly do not hold of any other dramatic forms.
The childishness of the old criticism which attaches the label of
some moral from the copybook to each piece, as its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.326" id="Page_i.326">[i.326]</a></span> lesson and point
of moral aim, is evident. In repudiating this Rousseau was
certainly right.<a name="FNanchor350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350">[350]</a> Both the assailants and the defenders of
the stage, however, commit the double error, first of supposing
that the drama is always the same thing, from the Agamemnon down to
the last triviality of a London theatre, and next of pitching the
discussion in too high a key, as if the effect or object of a stage
play in the modern era, where grave sentiment clothes itself in
other forms, were substantially anything more serious than an
evening's amusement. Apart from this, and in so far as the
discussion is confined to the highest dramatic expression, the true
answer to Rousseau is now a very plain one. The drama does not work
in the sphere of direct morality, though like everything else in
the world it has a moral or immoral aspect. It is an art of ideal
presentation, not concerned with the inculcation of immediate
practical lessons, but producing a stir in all our sympathetic
emotions, quickening the imagination, and so communicating a wider
life to the character of the spectator. This is what the drama in
the hands of a worthy master does; it is just what noble
composition in music does, and there is no more directly moralising
effect in the one than in the other. You must trust to the sum of
other agencies to guide the interest and sympathy thus quickened
into channels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.327" id="Page_i.327">[i.327]</a></span> of right action. Rousseau, like most other
controversialists, makes an attack of which the force rests on the
assumption that the special object of the attack is the single
influencing element and the one decisive instrument in making men
had or good. What he says about the drama would only be true if the
public went to the play all day long, and were accessible to no
other moral force whatever, modifying and counteracting such
lessons as they might learn at the theatre. He failed here as in
the wider controversy on the sciences and arts, to consider the
particular subject of discussion in relation to the whole of the
general medium in which character moves, and by whose manifold
action and reaction it is incessantly affected and variously
shaped.</p>
<p>So when he passed on from the theory of dramatic morality to the
matter which he had more at heart, namely, the practical effects of
introducing the drama into Geneva, he keeps out of sight all the
qualities in the Genevese citizen which would protect him against
the evil influence of the stage, though it is his anxiety for the
preservation of these very qualities that gives all its fire to his
eloquence. If the citizen really was what Rousseau insisted that he
was, then his virtues would surely neutralise the evil of the
drama; if not, the drama would do him no harm. We need not examine
the considerations in which Rousseau pointed out the special
reasons against introducing a theatre into his native town. It
would draw the artisans away from their work, cause wasteful
expenditure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.328" id="Page_i.328">[i.328]</a></span> money in amusements, break up the harmless and
inexpensive little clubs of men and the social gatherings of women.
The town was not populous enough to support a theatre, therefore
the government would have to provide one, and this would mean
increased taxation. All this was the secondary and merely
colourable support by argumentation, of a position that had been
reached and was really held by sentiment. Rousseau hated the
introduction of French plays in the same way that Cato hated the
introduction of fine talkers from Greece. It was an innovation, and
so habitual was it with Rousseau to look on all movement in the
direction of what the French writers called taste and cultivation
as depraving, that he cannot help taking for granted that any
change in manners associated with taste must necessarily be a
change for the worse. Thus the Letter to D'Alembert was essentially
a supplement to the first Discourse; it was an application of its
principles to a practical case. It was part of his general
reactionary protest against philosophers, poets, men of letters,
and all their works, without particular apprehension on the side of
the drama. Hence its reasoning is much less interesting than its
panegyric on the simplicity, robust courage, and manliness of the
Genevese, and its invective against the effeminacy and frivolity of
the Parisian. One of the most significant episodes in the
discussion is the lengthy criticism on the immortal Misanthrope of
Moli&#232;re. Rousseau admits it for the masterpiece of the comic
muse, though with characteristic perver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.329" id="Page_i.329">[i.329]</a></span>sity he insists that the
hero is not misanthropic enough, nor truly misanthropic at all,
because he flies into rage at small things affecting himself,
instead of at the large follies of the race. Again, he says that
Moli&#232;re makes Alceste ridiculous, virtuous as he is, in
order to win the applause of the pit. It is for the character of
Philinte, however, that Rousseau reserves all his spleen. He takes
care to describe him in terms which exactly hit Rousseau's own
conception of his philosophic enemies, who find all going well
because they have no interest in anything going better; who are
content with everybody, because they do not care for anybody; who
round a full table maintain that it is not true that the people are
hungry. As criticism, one cannot value this kind of analysis.
D'Alembert replied with a much more rational interpretation of the
great comedy, but finding himself seized with the critic's
besetting impertinence of improving masterpieces, he suddenly
stopped with the becoming reflection&#8212;&quot;But I perceive, sir, that I
am giving lessons to Moli&#232;re.&quot;<a name="FNanchor351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351">[351]</a></p>
<p>The constant thought of Paris gave Rousseau an admirable
occasion of painting two pictures in violent contrast, each as
over-coloured as the other by his mixed conceptions of the
Plutarchian antique and imaginary pastoral. We forget the
depravation of the stage and the ill living of comedians in
magnificent descriptions of the manly exercises and cheerful
festivities of the free people on the shores of the Lake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.330" id="Page_i.330">[i.330]</a></span> Geneva,
and in scornful satire on the Parisian seraglios, where some woman
assembles a number of men who are more like women than their
entertainers. We see on the one side the rude sons of the republic,
boxing, wrestling, running, in generous emulation, and on the other
the coxcombs of cultivated Paris imprisoned in a drawing-room,
&quot;rising up, sitting down, incessantly going and coming to the
fire-place, to the window, taking up a screen and putting it down
again a hundred times, turning over books, flitting from picture to
picture, turning and pirouetting about the room, while the idol
stretched motionless on a couch all the time is only alive in her
tongue and eyes&quot; (p. 161). If the rough patriots of the Lake are
less polished in speech, they are all the weightier in reason; they
do not escape by a pleasantry or a compliment; each feeling himself
attacked by all the forces of his adversary, he is obliged to
employ all his own to defend himself, and this is how a mind
acquires strength and precision. There may be here and there a
licentious phrase, but there is no ground for alarm in that. It is
not the least rude who are always the most pure, and even a rather
clownish speech is better than that artificial style in which the
two sexes seduce one another, and familiarise themselves decently
with vice. 'Tis true our Swiss drinks too much, but after all let
us not calumniate even vice; as a rule drinkers are cordial and
frank, good, upright, just, loyal, brave, and worthy folk. Wherever
people have most abhorrence of drunkenness, be sure they have most
reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.331" id="Page_i.331">[i.331]</a></span> to fear lest its indiscretion should betray intrigue and
treachery. In Switzerland it is almost thought well of, while at
Naples they hold it in horror; but at bottom which is the more to
be dreaded, the intemperance of the Swiss or the reserve of the
Italian? It is hardly surprising to learn that the people of Geneva
were as little gratified by this well-meant panegyric on their
jollity as they had been by another writer's friendly eulogy on
their Socinianism.<a name="FNanchor352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352">[352]</a></p>
<p>The reader who was not moved to turn brute and walk on all fours
by the pictures of the state of nature in the Discourses, may find
it more difficult to resist the charm of the brotherly festivities
and simple pastimes which in the Letter to D'Alembert the patriot
holds up to the admiration of his countrymen and the envy of
foreigners. The writer is in Sparta, but he tempers his Sparta with
a something from Charmettes. Never before was there so attractive a
combination of martial austerity with the grace of the idyll. And
the interest of these pictures is much more than literary; it is
historic also. They were the original version of those great
gatherings in the Champ de Mars and strange suppers of fraternity
during the progress of the Revolution in Paris, which have amused
the cynical ever since, but which pointed to a not unworthy
aspiration. The fine gentlemen whom Rousseau did so well to despise
had then all fled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.332" id="Page_i.332">[i.332]</a></span> the common people under Rousseauite leaders
were doing the best they could to realise on the banks of the Seine
the imaginary joymaking and simple fellowship which had been first
dreamed of for the banks of Lake Leman, and commended with an
eloquence that struck new chords in minds satiated or untouched by
the brilliance of mere literature. There was no real state of
things in Geneva corresponding to the gracious picture which
Rousseau so generously painted, and some of the citizens complained
that his account of their social joys was as little deserved as his
ingenious vindication of their hearty feeling for barrel or bottle
was little founded.<a name="FNanchor353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353">[353]</a></p>
<p>The glorification of love of country did little for the Genevese
for whom it was meant, but it penetrated many a soul in the greater
nation that lay sunk in helpless indifference to its own ruin.
Nowhere else among the writers who are the glory of France at this
time, is any serious eulogy of patriotism. Rousseau glows with it,
and though he always speaks in connection with Geneva, yet there is
in his words a generous breadth and fire which gave them an
irresistible contagiousness. There are many passages of this fine
persuasive force in the Letter to D'Alembert; perhaps this,
referring to the citizens of Geneva who had gone elsewhere in
search of fortune, is as good as another. Do you think that the
opening of a theatre, he asks, will bring them back to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.333" id="Page_i.333">[i.333]</a></span> mother
city? No; &quot;each of them must feel that he can never find anywhere
else what he has left behind in his own land; an invincible charm
must call him back to the spot that he ought never to have quitted;
the recollection of their first exercises, their first pleasures,
their first sights, must remain deeply graven in their hearts; the
soft impressions made in the days of their youth must abide and
grow stronger with advancing years, while a thousand others wax
dim; in the midst of the pomp of great cities and all their
cheerless magnificence, a secret voice must for ever cry in the
depth of the wanderer's soul, Ah, where are the games and holidays
of my youth? Where is the concord of the townsmen, where the public
brotherhood? Where is pure joy and true mirth? Where are peace,
freedom, equity? Let us hasten to seek all these. With the heart of
a Genevese, with a city as smiling, a landscape as full of delight,
a government as just, with pleasures so true and so pure, and all
that is needed to be able to relish them, how is it that we do not
all adore our birth-land? It was thus in old times that by modest
feasts and homely games her citizens were called back by that
Sparta which I can never quote often enough as an example for us;
thus in Athens in the midst of fine art, thus in Susa in the very
bosom of luxury and soft delights, the wearied Spartan sighed after
his coarse pastimes and exhausting exercises&quot; (p. 211).<a name="FNanchor354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354">[354]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.334" id="Page_i.334">[i.334]</a></span></p>

<p>Any reference to this powerfully written, though most
sophistical piece, would be imperfect which should omit its
slightly virulent onslaught upon women and the passion which women
inspire. The modern drama, he said, being too feeble to rise to
high themes, has fallen back on love; and on this hint he proceeds
to a censure of love as a poetic theme, and a bitter estimate of
women as companions for men, which might have pleased Calvin or
Knox in his sternest mood. The same eloquence which showed men the
superior delights of the state of nature, now shows the superior
fitness of the oriental seclusion of women; it makes a sympathetic
reader tremble at the want of modesty, purity, and decency, in the
part which women are allowed to take by the infatuated men of a
modern community.</p>
<p>All this, again, is directed against &quot;that philosophy of a day,
which is born and dies in the corner of a city, and would fain
stifle the cry of nature and the unanimous voice of the human race&quot;
(p. 131). The same intrepid spirits who had brought reason to bear
upon the current notions of providence, inspiration, ecclesiastical
tradition, and other unlighted spots in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.335" id="Page_i.335">[i.335]</a></span> the human mind, had
perceived that the subjection of women to a secondary place
belonged to the same category, and could not any more successfully
be defended by reason. Instead of raging against women for their
boldness, their frivolousness, and the rest, as our passionate
sentimentalist did, the opposite school insisted that all these
evils were due to the folly of treating women with gallantry
instead of respect, and to the blindness of refusing an equally
vigorous and masculine education to those who must be the closest
companions of educated man. This was the view forced upon the most
rational observers of a society where women were so powerful, and
so absolutely unfit by want of intellectual training for the right
use of social power. D'Alembert expressed this view in a few pages
of forcible pleading in his reply to Rousseau,<a name="FNanchor355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355">[355]</a> and some
thirty-two years later, when all questions had become political
(1790), Condorcet ably extended the same line of argument so as to
make it cover the claims of women to all the rights of
citizenship.<a name="FNanchor356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356">[356]</a> From the nature of the case, however, it
is impossible to confute by reason a man who denies that the matter
in dispute is within the decision and jurisdiction of reason, and
who supposes that his own opinion is placed out of the reach of
attack when he declares it to be the unanimous voice of the human
race. We may remember that the author of this philippic against
love was at the very moment brood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.336" id="Page_i.336">[i.336]</a></span>ing over the New Helo&#239;sa, and
was fresh from strange transports at the feet of the Julie whom we
know.</p>
<p>The Letter on the Stage was the definite mark of Rousseau's
schism from the philosophic congregation. Has Jean Jacques turned a
father of the church? asked Voltaire. Deserters who fight against
their country ought to be hung. The little flock are falling to
devouring one another. This arch-madman, who might have been
something, if he would only have been guided by his brethren of the
Encyclop&#230;dia, takes it into his head to make a band of his
own. He writes against the stage, after writing a bad play of his
own. He finds four or five rotten staves of Diogenes' tub, and
instals himself therein to bark at his friends.<a name="FNanchor357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357">[357]</a> D'Alembert was
more tolerant, but less clear-sighted. He insisted that the little
flock should do its best to heal divisions instead of widening
them. Jean Jacques, he said, &quot;is a madman who is very clever, and
who is only clever when he is in a fever; it is best therefore
neither to cure nor to insult him.&quot;</p>
<p>Rousseau made the preface to the Letter on the Stage an occasion
for a proclamation of his final breach with Diderot. &quot;I once,&quot; he
said, &quot;possessed a severe and judicious Aristarchus; I have him no
longer, and wish for him no longer.&quot; To this he added in a footnote
a passage from Ecclesiasticus, to the effect that if you have drawn
a sword on a friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i.337" id="Page_i.337">[i.337]</a></span> there still remains a way open, and if you have
spoken cheerless words to him concord is still possible, but
malicious reproach and the betrayal of a secret&#8212;these things
banish friendship beyond return. This was the end of his personal
connection with the men whom he always contemptuously called the
Holbachians. After 1760 the great stream divided into two; the
rationalist and the emotional schools became visibly antipathetic,
and the voice of the epoch was no longer single or
undistracted.</p>

eight years after Rousseau's letter, the government gave permission
for the establishment of a theatre in the town. It was burnt down

the result of design, instigated by Rousseau (<i>Corr.</i> v. 299,
April 26, 1768). The theatre was not re-erected until 1783, when
the oligarchic party regained the ascendancy and brought back with
them the drama, which the democrats in their reign would not
permit.</p>
